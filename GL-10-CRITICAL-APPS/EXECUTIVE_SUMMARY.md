**Mitigation:** Diversify across 10 apps, focus on voluntary demand, build for "directional certainty"

### Risk 2: Competitive Response (High Likelihood, Medium Impact)
**Mitigation:** 18-24 month first-mover advantage, technology moat, best-of-breed integration

### Risk 3: Team Scaling (Medium Likelihood, High Impact)
**Mitigation:** Agent-as-Employee strategy, offshore engineering, acquisitions, prioritize TIER 1 apps
