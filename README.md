> **We don't build climate calculations, we orchestrate them.**

GreenLang is the universal orchestration and composition platform for climate intelligence. Like LangChain revolutionized LLM applications by making them composable, GreenLang makes ANY climate calculation, ANY emission methodology, and ANY sustainability framework composable and chainable.

## 🚀 Why GreenLang?

**The Problem:** Every company builds their own climate calculation engine from scratch. Emission factors are hardcoded. Methodologies are locked in. Integration is impossible.

**The Solution:** GreenLang provides the orchestration layer that makes all climate intelligence pluggable, composable, and shareable - just like LangChain did for LLMs.

| LangChain | GreenLang |
|-----------|-----------|
| Orchestrates any LLM | Orchestrates any climate intelligence |
| Chains & workflows | Pipelines & workflows |
| Tools & functions | Packs & agents |
| Document loaders | Data connectors |
| Vector stores | Climate data stores |
| LangChain Hub | GreenLang Hub |
| Memory & context | State & compliance tracking |

## 💡 The Vision: Infrastructure, Not Framework

```python
# OLD WAY: Hardcoded framework
from some_climate_lib import calculate_emissions
result = calculate_emissions(data)  # Locked to one methodology

# GREENLANG WAY: Universal orchestration
from greenlang import Pipeline, load

# Load ANY climate intelligence - plug and play
emissions = load("ghg-protocol/scope-123")      # GHG Protocol standard
science = load("sbti/target-validator")         # Science-based targets
regional = load("india/bee-compliance")         # Regional compliance

# Compose them like LEGO blocks
pipeline = Pipeline()
    .add(emissions)           # Calculate emissions
    .add(science)            # Validate against SBTi
    .add(regional)           # Check regional compliance
    .parallel()              # Run in parallel
    .with_policy("sox-compliant")  # Enforce governance

result = pipeline.run(data)  # Universal execution
```

## 🎯 Core Capabilities

### 1. Universal Climate Intelligence Interface

```python
# ANY calculation becomes a pack
class ClimatePack(Protocol):
    """The universal interface - like LangChain's LLM interface"""

    async def invoke(self, input: Dict, config: Config) -> Dict:
        """Single universal method - works with ANY climate logic"""
        pass
```

### 2. Composable Pipelines

```python
# Chain climate intelligence like LangChain chains LLMs
from greenlang import chain

# Natural language composition
result = chain(
    "Calculate Scope 1-3 emissions for our India operations using GHG Protocol, "
    "validate against Science-Based Targets, and generate TCFD report"
)

# Or programmatic composition
pipeline = (
    load("emissions/scope-1") |
    load("emissions/scope-2") |
    load("emissions/scope-3") |
    load("reporting/tcfd")
)
```

### 3. Universal Data Connectors

```python
# Connect to ANY data source
from greenlang.connectors import connect

# Just like LangChain's document loaders
data = connect()
    .api("https://erp.company.com/energy")
    .database("postgresql://emissions_db")
    .iot("mqtt://sensors/electricity")
    .satellite("sentinel-5p/methane")
    .files("s3://bucket/consumption/")
    .normalize()  # Automatic unit conversion & alignment
```

### 4. Pack Marketplace (Like LangChain Hub)

```

### 5. Policy as Code

```python
# Automatic compliance enforcement
@policy("sox-compliant")
@policy("gdpr-compliant")
@policy("iso-27001")
class EnterprisePipeline(Pipeline):
    """Policies enforced at runtime - like LangChain guardrails"""
    pass
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# From PyPI (v0.2.0 coming this week)
pip install greenlang

# From source (current)
git clone https://github.com/greenlang/greenlang
cd greenlang
pip install -e .
```

### Your First Pipeline

```python
from greenlang import Pipeline, load, connect

# 1. Load the intelligence you need
emissions_pack = load("ghg-protocol/scope-123")
reporting_pack = load("tcfd/climate-risk")

# 2. Connect your data
data = connect()
    .api("https://api.company.com/energy/consumption")
    .normalize()

# 3. Compose and run
pipeline = Pipeline([emissions_pack, reporting_pack])
result = pipeline.run(data)

print(f"Total emissions: {result['total_co2e']} tCO2e")
print(f"Climate risk score: {result['risk_score']}")
```

## 🌟 Use Cases

### For Developers
```python
# Build once, run anywhere
my_pack = create_pack(
    name="custom-emissions",
    logic=my_calculation_logic,
    schema=my_data_schema
)
publish(my_pack)  # Share with the world
```

### For Enterprises
```python
# Enforce governance across all calculations
Pipeline.default_policies = [
    "sox-compliant",
    "data-residency-us",
    "audit-logging"
]
# Now EVERY calculation is compliant
```

### For Startups
```python
# Don't build from scratch - compose existing intelligence
pipeline = load("greenlang/starter-kit")  # Full emission calculation stack
result = pipeline.run(your_data)  # Production-ready in minutes
```

## 📊 Pack Examples

### Converting Hardcoded Agents to Universal Packs

**BEFORE: Monolithic Agent (Locked In)**
```python
from greenlang.agents import FuelAgent
agent = FuelAgent()  # Hardcoded logic
result = agent.calculate("diesel", 1000)  # Single methodology
```

**AFTER: Universal Pack (Plug & Play)**
```python
from greenlang import load

# Load ANY fuel calculation methodology
pack = load("ghg-protocol/fuel")      # OR
pack = load("iso-14064/fuel")         # OR
pack = load("company/custom-fuel")    # OR
pack = load("regional/india-fuel")

# Universal interface - same for ALL packs
result = pack.invoke({"type": "diesel", "amount": 1000})
```

## 🚀 The Bottom Line

**GreenLang is to climate intelligence what Linux is to operating systems:**
- Not an application, but the platform all applications run on
- Not owned by one company, but by the community
- Not locked to one way, but infinitely extensible

**We're not building another climate calculator. We're building the infrastructure that makes ALL climate intelligence composable.**

Join us in making climate intelligence universal.

**Build once. Run anywhere. Compose everything.**
