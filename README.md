> **"The world runs on data. Tomorrow, it will run on GreenLang."**

**GreenLang is the Climate Operating System** - enterprise-grade infrastructure for building, deploying, and managing climate-aware applications at planetary scale. From single buildings to entire supply chains, from startups to Fortune 500, GreenLang provides the intelligence layer the world needs to measure, manage, and reduce climate impact.

---

## 🚀 The Vision: Climate OS for the Planet

Every enterprise needs climate intelligence. Currently, they build it themselves (slow, expensive, inconsistent) or use point solutions (fragmented, non-integrated).

**GreenLang changes everything.**

We're building the **Climate Operating System** - the platform that becomes as essential for climate intelligence as Linux is for computing, as AWS is for cloud infrastructure.

### The Mission (2025-2028)

From **10 engineers** to **500 engineers**.
From **$0 ARR** to **$200M ARR**.
From **unknown startup** to **publicly-traded climate tech leader**.

**Timeline:**
- **2025 (Now):** Foundation - 58.7% complete, world-class infrastructure built
- **2026:** Production Platform - v1.0.0 GA, 750+ customers, $7.5M ARR
- **2027:** Market Leadership - 5,000+ customers, $50M ARR, EBITDA positive
- **2028:** Industry Standard - 50,000+ users, $200M ARR, IPO, "The AWS of Climate"

**We're not just building software. We're building the future.**

## ⚡ What Makes GreenLang Different?

### AI-Native from Day One
Every component powered by GPT-4, Claude-3, and proprietary climate models. Not AI-wrappers, not chatbots - **real intelligence** embedded in every calculation, every recommendation, every decision.

### Infrastructure-First Design
Built like AWS, not like a SaaS app:
- **Multi-tenant orchestration** with Kubernetes
- **99.99% SLA** for mission-critical operations
- **Autoscaling** from 10 to 100,000 concurrent users
- **Global edge network** for <100ms latency worldwide

### Security by Design
- **Zero hardcoded secrets** (100% externalized)
- **Sigstore signing** for every artifact
- **SBOM generation** (SPDX & CycloneDX) for supply chain security
- **Policy-as-code** with OPA/Rego for governance
- **SOC 2 Type 2 ready** (Q4 2026 target)

### Developer-First Platform
```python
# This is all you need to calculate building emissions
from greenlang.sdk import GreenLangClient

client = GreenLangClient()
result = client.calculate_building_emissions({
    "area_m2": 5000,
    "electricity_kwh": 50000,
    "gas_therms": 1000
})

print(f"Annual emissions: {result.total_emissions_tons:.1f} tCO2e")
```

**That's it. No API keys, no complex setup, no PhD required.**

---

### What's Next (The 41.3% Gap)

**Critical Path to v1.0.0 (June 2026):**

1. **Intelligent Agents (Priority 1)** - Transform 16 calculators into 100 AI-powered agents
2. **ML Forecasting (Priority 2)** - Time series forecasting, anomaly detection, optimization
