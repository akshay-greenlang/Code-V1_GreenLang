                Building Energy Efficiency
                
                Buildings account for approximately 40% of global energy consumption and 36% of 
                CO2 emissions. Key strategies for reducing building emissions include:
                
                1. Energy-efficient HVAC systems
                2. Improved insulation
                3. LED lighting
                4. Smart building controls
                5. Renewable energy integration
                
                Energy intensity benchmarks:
                - Office buildings: 100-300 kWh/m²/year
                - Retail: 150-400 kWh/m²/year
                - Industrial: 200-500 kWh/m²/year
