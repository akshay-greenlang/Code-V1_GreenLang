                The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard classifies emissions into three scopes:
                
                Scope 1: Direct emissions from owned or controlled sources
                - On-site fuel combustion
                - Company vehicles
                - Fugitive emissions
                
                Scope 2: Indirect emissions from purchased electricity, steam, heating & cooling
                - Location-based method: Uses average emission factors for the grid
                - Market-based method: Uses emission factors from contractual instruments
                
                Scope 3: All other indirect emissions in the value chain
                - Purchased goods and services
                - Business travel
                - Employee commuting
                - Waste disposal
