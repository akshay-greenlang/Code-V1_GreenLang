                Renewable Energy Sources
                
                Renewable energy sources are crucial for decarbonization:
                
                Solar Energy:
                - Zero operational emissions
                - Lifecycle emissions: 40-50 g CO2/kWh
                - Capacity factors: 15-25%
                
                Wind Energy:
                - Zero operational emissions
                - Lifecycle emissions: 10-15 g CO2/kWh
                - Capacity factors: 25-45%
                
                Comparison with fossil fuels:
                - Coal: 820-1000 g CO2/kWh
                - Natural Gas: 490 g CO2/kWh
