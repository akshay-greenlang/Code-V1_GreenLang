## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Who/What is GreenLang?

**GreenLang is a dual-architecture Climate Intelligence Framework that uniquely combines being BOTH an infrastructure platform AND a domain-specific framework for climate applications.**

This is not an either/or scenario - the codebase reveals a sophisticated implementation that operates on two complementary levels:

1. **Climate Intelligence Framework** - A comprehensive suite of 15+ specialized agents for emissions calculations, building analysis, and decarbonization strategies
2. **Infrastructure Platform** - An enterprise-grade platform for building, deploying, and orchestrating climate-aware applications

**Key Finding:** GreenLang has successfully achieved what few frameworks attempt - maintaining deep domain expertise while providing flexible infrastructure that allows others to build on top of it. It's positioned as "The LangChain of Climate Intelligence."
