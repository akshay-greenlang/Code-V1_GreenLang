FINAL VERDICT
================================================================================

GL-002 BoilerEfficiencyOptimizer is a WELL-ARCHITECTED, FEATURE-COMPLETE agent
with EXCELLENT SPECIFICATION and BUSINESS CASE.

However, it is NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION due to:
  • 8 critical bugs blocking code execution
  • Type hints gap (45% vs 100% requirement)
  • Security vulnerabilities (hardcoded credentials)
  • Missing operational infrastructure (monitoring, alerting, health checks)
  • Incomplete deployment setup

PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT: **NO_GO**
REMEDIATION FEASIBLE: **YES**
TIMELINE TO PRODUCTION: **3-4 weeks**

With focused effort on Phase 1 remediation (24-26 hours), the agent will meet
all production standards and be ready for deployment.
