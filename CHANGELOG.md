- Regional efficiency standards (US, EU, UK, CN)
- Altitude and maintenance adjustments
- Oversizing factor calculations

#### Utility Libraries
- `unit_converter.py`: Centralized energy, mass, volume conversions
- `performance_tracker.py`: Performance monitoring and benchmarking with context managers

#### Configuration Management
- External JSON configuration for boiler efficiencies
- JSON Schema validation for input data
- Support for fuel type aliasing (oil â†’ fuel_oil)

### Changed
- Maintained version at 0.0.1
- Enhanced FuelAgent with 17 essential components
- Enhanced BoilerAgent with 17 essential components plus 8 additional features
- Updated GREENLANG_DOCUMENTATION.md with detailed agent features
- Updated README.md with new features section

### Security
- Removed exposed API keys from repository
- Updated .env.example with clear documentation about optional API features
- Added security warnings in README.md about not committing secrets
- Ensured .gitignore properly excludes sensitive files (.env, api_keys.json, secrets.yaml)
- Documented that all core functionality works without API keys
- Added new dependencies: psutil, jsonschema, aiofiles

### Fixed
- FuelAgent missing components: fixtures, performance helpers, constants, recommendations
- BoilerAgent missing components: performance optimizations, integration examples
- Emission factor lookups now use correct method signatures
- Fuel type mapping for compatibility (oil â†’ fuel_oil, lpg â†’ propane)

### Removed
- 27 duplicate test files and redundant documentation
- Consolidated overlapping fixture files
- Removed redundant workflow examples
