service:
  name: "FactorBroker"
  version: "1.0.0"
  type: "core_service"
  category: "data_resolution"

  description: >
    Runtime emission factor resolution service with license compliance.
    Resolves factor IDs to licensed sources at runtime, with versioning
    (GWP set, region, unit, pedigree), caching within license terms,
    and no bulk redistribution to ensure ecoinvent compliance.

  purpose: >
    The Factor Broker serves as the central service for emission factor
    resolution, abstracting complexity of multiple data sources,
    license compliance, versioning, and regional adaptation.

# ============================================================================
# BUSINESS VALUE
# ============================================================================
business_value:
  problem_solved: >
    Emission factor management is complex: multiple sources (ecoinvent,
    DESNZ, EPA), licensing restrictions (ecoinvent prohibits bulk
    redistribution), GWP standard evolution (AR5 → AR6), and regional
    adaptation requirements. Manual management leads to compliance
    violations and calculation errors.

  solution: >
    Factor Broker provides runtime resolution with license-compliant
    caching, automatic cascading fallback (ecoinvent → DESNZ → EPA),
    GWP standard handling, and complete provenance tracking.
