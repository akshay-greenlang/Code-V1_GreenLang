  description: >
    Comprehensive cross-walk mapping between GHG Protocol Scope 3 Standard,
    ESRS (EU CSRD), CDP Climate Change, IFRS S2, and ISO 14083:2023.
    Ensures single source of truth for multi-standard reporting.

  purpose: >
    Enable automatic report generation across multiple frameworks by mapping
    data points, calculations, and disclosure requirements. Support 50,000+
    EU companies (ESRD mandatory), 18,000+ CDP reporters, 120+ countries
    (IFRS S2 baseline).
