## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### 1.1 Project Purpose

Build the world's most advanced **Scope 3 Value Chain Carbon Intelligence Platform** that enables enterprises to:
- **Accurately calculate** Scope 3 emissions across all 15 GHG Protocol categories
- **Automate supplier engagement** at scale (1,000s of suppliers)
- **Leverage AI intelligently** (hybrid approach: zero-hallucination for actuals + AI for estimates)
- **Ensure audit compliance** (complete provenance chain, SHA-256 integrity)
- **Multi-standard reporting** (GHG Protocol, CDP, SBTi in one platform)

### 1.2 Business Justification

**Market Opportunity:**
- **TAM:** $8 Billion (Scope 3 software + data services)
- **Revenue Target:** $5M ARR (Year 1), $30M (Year 2), $120M (Year 3)
- **Target Customers:** Fortune 500 enterprises with complex supply chains

**Strategic Rationale:**
1. **Regulatory Drivers:** SEC Climate Disclosure, California SB 253, EU CSRD (all require Scope 3)
2. **Net-Zero Commitments:** 90% of Fortune 500 have net-zero targets (impossible without Scope 3)
3. **Investor Pressure:** CDP, TCFD mandates increasing
4. **Competitive Advantage:** No competitor has our hybrid AI + provenance approach

**ROI Projection:**
- **Investment:** $2.5M (44 weeks development)
- **Year 1 Revenue:** $5M ARR (30 customers @ $165K avg)
- **Year 1 ROI:** 2:1 (revenue / investment)
- **Cumulative ROI (3 years):** 48:1 ($120M ARR / $2.5M investment)

### 1.3 Strategic Alignment

**GreenLang Vision Alignment:**
> "Build 5 critical climate applications for 2025-2030 targeting $645M ARR"

**This project is App #2 of 5:**
1. ‚úÖ CSRD Platform (100% complete, production-ready)
2. üî¥ **Scope 3 Tracker** (THIS PROJECT - highest priority!)
3. ‚è≥ Building BPS (Q1 2026 start)
4. ‚è≥ Product PCF/Passport (Q2 2026 start)
5. ‚è≥ Carbon Market Integrity (Q1 2027 start)

**GreenLang Roadmap Milestones:**
| Year | Goal | GL-VCCI Contribution |
|------|------|---------------------|
| 2026 | $10M ARR, 200 customers | $5M ARR, 30 customers |
| 2027 | $75M ARR, 1,000 customers | $30M ARR, 150 customers |
| 2028 | $200M ARR, 5,000 customers | $120M ARR, 500 customers |
