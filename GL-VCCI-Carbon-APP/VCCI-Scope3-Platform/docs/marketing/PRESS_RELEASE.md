# FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

## GL-VCCI Launches Industry's First ML-Powered Scope 3 Carbon Intelligence Platform
### *New SaaS solution combines automated categorization, real-time supplier collaboration, and multi-framework compliance to help global enterprises achieve 80%+ Scope 3 coverage in weeks*

**[CITY, STATE] – [DATE]** – GreenLang, a leader in enterprise carbon intelligence software, today announced the general availability of the **GL-VCCI Scope 3 Carbon Intelligence Platform v2.0**, the industry's first purpose-built solution combining machine learning automation, real-time PCF (Product Carbon Footprint) exchange, and multi-framework compliance for enterprise Scope 3 accounting.

Following a successful six-month beta program with design partners including global manufacturing, retail, and technology companies, GL-VCCI is now available to enterprises seeking to meet emerging regulatory requirements including CSRD/ESRS E1, CDP Climate Change, ISO 14083, and IFRS S2.

### **The Scope 3 Challenge**

Scope 3 emissions—indirect emissions from supply chains—represent up to 95% of most companies' carbon footprint yet remain the most difficult to measure accurately. Traditional approaches rely on manual transaction categorization, spreadsheet-based calculations, and annual supplier surveys that achieve less than 25% response rates, leaving companies with incomplete data and compliance risk.

"Global enterprises are facing a perfect storm: mandatory climate disclosures, investor pressure, and consumer expectations—all requiring accurate Scope 3 data," said **[CEO Name]**, CEO of GreenLang. "But legacy approaches can't scale. Companies need intelligent automation, not more headcount and consultants."

### **ML-Powered Intelligence Meets Enterprise Scale**

GL-VCCI addresses the Scope 3 data gap with four breakthrough capabilities:

**1. 94% Accurate ML Categorization** – Proprietary machine learning models automatically categorize procurement transactions across all 15 GHG Protocol Scope 3 categories, reducing manual work by 85%. The platform processes 100,000+ transactions per hour with full audit trails.

**2. Real-Time PCF Exchange** – Industry-first support for PACT Pathfinder v2.0 and Catena-X standards enables real-time Product Carbon Footprint exchange with suppliers, eliminating manual surveys. Beta customers achieved 83% supplier response rates—more than 3x the industry average.

**3. Multi-Framework Compliance** – One-click report generation for ESRS E1, CDP Climate Change, GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, ISO 14083, and IFRS S2. Companies can generate five compliance reports in minutes instead of weeks.

**4. Enterprise Integration** – Pre-built connectors for SAP S/4HANA, Oracle Fusion Cloud, and Workday enable 100% automated data ingestion with zero manual data entry. RESTful APIs support custom integrations.

### **Proven Results from Beta Program**

During the six-month beta program with six design partners, GL-VCCI achieved:

- **NPS of 74** (target: 60)—demonstrating exceptional customer satisfaction
- **83% supplier coverage** vs. industry average <25%
- **22 days to first value** (target: <30 days)
- **94% ML categorization accuracy** across 2.5M transactions
- **99.6% platform uptime** with SOC 2 Type II certification

"GL-VCCI transformed our Scope 3 program from quarterly guesstimates to real-time intelligence," said **[Customer Quote – Sustainability Director]**, Sustainability Director at **[GlobalTech Industries]**, a $12B manufacturing company. "We went from 18% supplier coverage to 81% in 90 days, and our audit preparation time dropped from three weeks to two days. This is the platform we've been waiting for."

### **Addressing CSRD Urgency**

With the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) requiring thousands of companies to report detailed Scope 3 emissions starting in 2025-2026, demand for automated carbon accounting solutions is accelerating. Non-compliance can result in fines up to €20 million or 4% of annual turnover.

"CSRD is a game-changer—it's not voluntary disclosure, it's mandatory audit-grade reporting," said **[CPO Name]**, Chief Product Officer at GreenLang. "GL-VCCI was purpose-built for this new era of climate accountability. Our customers aren't choosing between speed and accuracy anymore—they're getting both."

### **Built for Enterprise Security and Compliance**

GL-VCCI is SOC 2 Type II certified with enterprise-grade security including:
- End-to-end encryption (at rest and in transit)
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- GDPR and CCPA compliance
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- 99.9% uptime SLA

The platform is deployed on AWS infrastructure across multiple regions (US, EU, APAC) to meet data residency requirements.
