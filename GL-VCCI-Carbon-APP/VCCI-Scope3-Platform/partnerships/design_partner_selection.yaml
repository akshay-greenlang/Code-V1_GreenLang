# ============================================================================
# RISK MITIGATION
# ============================================================================

risk_mitigation:
  description: "Identified risks and mitigation strategies for design partner pilot"

  risks:
    - risk: "Partner resource constraints (1-2 FTE commitment not met)"
      likelihood: "Medium"
      impact: "High"
      mitigation:
        - "Secure executive sponsorship upfront (enforce commitment)"
        - "Automate data extraction (minimize partner IT burden)"
        - "Provide dedicated CSM for each partner (remove friction)"

    - risk: "ERP integration complexity (API issues, data access)"
      likelihood: "Medium"
      impact: "High"
      mitigation:
        - "Pre-validate ERP versions and API availability in Week 2"
        - "Fallback: Manual data upload (CSV templates) if API fails"
        - "Dedicated integration engineer for each ERP type"

    - risk: "Low supplier response rate (<50%)"
      likelihood: "Medium"
      impact: "High"
      mitigation:
        - "Pilot supplier engagement emails with 3 partners (A/B testing)"
        - "Provide email templates and incentives (PCF data = preferred supplier status)"
        - "Executive sponsor outreach to strategic suppliers (if needed)"

    - risk: "Data quality issues (poor DQI, missing key fields)"
      likelihood: "High"
      impact: "Medium"
      mitigation:
        - "Conduct data quality assessment in Week 3 (before calculation)"
        - "Partner training on data cleanup (if needed)"
        - "Graceful degradation: Use Tier 2/3 methods if Tier 1 data unavailable"

    - risk: "Partner dissatisfaction (unmet expectations, NPS < 7)"
      likelihood: "Low"
      impact: "Critical"
      mitigation:
        - "Set realistic expectations upfront (pilot = MVP, not GA)"
        - "Weekly check-ins and rapid issue resolution"
        - "Mid-pilot survey (Week 7) to course-correct if needed"

    - risk: "Timeline slippage (pilot extends beyond Week 12)"
      likelihood: "Medium"
      impact: "Medium"
      mitigation:
        - "Phased approach: Prioritize Category 1 (defer Cat 4/6 if needed)"
        - "Weekly status tracking and early escalation"
        - "Buffer: 2-week extension allowed (max Week 14)"
