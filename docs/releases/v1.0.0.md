## New Features

### Feature 1: Process Heat Monitoring Agents

Intelligent software agents that continuously monitor process heat systems, providing real-time visibility into temperature, fuel flow, and other critical parameters.

**Key capabilities:**
- Real-time data collection via OPC-UA, Modbus, and MQTT
- Multi-zone monitoring with configurable hierarchies
- Automatic data validation and quality scoring
- Sub-second data refresh rates

**How to use:**
```python
from greenlang.agents import ProcessHeatAgent

agent = ProcessHeatAgent(
    name="furnace_zone_1",
    config={
        "monitoring_interval": 1000,
        "temperature_range": {"min": 800, "max": 1200}
    }
)
agent.start()
```

**Workaround:** Deploy agents across multiple nodes or increase available memory.

**Status:** Optimization planned for v1.1.0

**Tracking:** [Issue #142](https://github.com/greenlang/greenlang/issues/142)

### Issue 2: OPC-UA reconnection delay

**Symptoms:** After OPC-UA server restart, reconnection may take up to 60 seconds.

**Workaround:** Manually restart the agent service if faster reconnection is needed.

**Status:** Fix planned for v1.0.1

**Tracking:** [Issue #156](https://github.com/greenlang/greenlang/issues/156)

### Issue 3: Dashboard slow with > 50 zones displayed

**Symptoms:** Dashboard refresh rate degrades when displaying more than 50 zones simultaneously.

**Workaround:** Use filtered views to display fewer zones at once.

**Status:** Under investigation

**Tracking:** [Issue #163](https://github.com/greenlang/greenlang/issues/163)
