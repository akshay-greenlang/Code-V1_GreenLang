# HEARTLAND FOODS: 11% Fuel Reduction with BoilerOptimizer

**Industry:** Food & Beverage
**Location:** Cedar Rapids, Iowa
**Boiler Configuration:** 4 x 60 MMBtu/hr fire-tube
**Annual Fuel Spend:** $1.4 million
**BoilerOptimizer Edition:** Professional

---

## Executive Summary

Heartland Foods, a leading producer of frozen vegetables, implemented BoilerOptimizer to optimize their steam generation system supporting cooking, blanching, and CIP operations. Within 12 months, they achieved 11% fuel reduction ($154,000 annual savings), eliminated 2 major unplanned shutdowns, and reduced compliance documentation time by 85%.

**Key Results:**

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Fuel Efficiency | 79.2% | 87.8% | 8.6 point gain |
| Annual Fuel Cost | $1,400,000 | $1,246,000 | $154,000 savings |
| Unplanned Downtime | 72 hrs/yr | 18 hrs/yr | 75% reduction |

---

## Customer Profile

### Company Overview

Heartland Foods operates a 400,000 square foot frozen vegetable processing facility in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The plant processes over 200 million pounds of vegetables annually, including corn, peas, beans, and mixed vegetables for retail and foodservice markets.

### Steam System

| Characteristic | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Number of Boilers | 4 |
| Total Capacity | 240 MMBtu/hr |
| Boiler Types | Fire-tube (Cleaver-Brooks) |
| Fuel Type | Natural gas |
| Steam Usage | Cooking, blanching, CIP, sterilization |
| Operating Schedule | 24/7 during season, 16/5 off-season |

---

## The Challenge

### Business Context

With thin margins in frozen food processing and increasing pressure from customers to demonstrate sustainability commitments, Heartland Foods needed to reduce energy costs while maintaining strict food safety and quality standards. Steam reliability was critical - any unplanned outage during peak season meant spoiled product and missed shipments.

### Operational Challenges

- Boilers running 6-8% below design efficiency with no visibility into root causes
- Manual combustion tuning quarterly, with efficiency drifting between service visits
- Two unexpected tube failures in the past three years, each costing $60,000+ in emergency repairs
- Operators spending 15+ hours weekly on manual rounds, log sheets, and efficiency calculations
- NESHAP compliance documentation consuming 80+ hours annually

### Previous Approaches

The plant had Cleaver-Brooks Hawk installed on two boilers, but it only provided basic data logging without optimization recommendations. "Hawk told us what happened yesterday," noted the Plant Engineer. "It didn't tell us what to do about it or what might happen tomorrow."

> **Customer Quote:**
> "We knew we were wasting fuel, but we couldn't pinpoint where or how much. Our operators were experienced, but they couldn't watch four boilers every minute of every day."
>
> -- Mike Johansen, Plant Engineer, Heartland Foods

---

## The Solution

### Why BoilerOptimizer

Heartland Foods evaluated BoilerOptimizer against upgrading their Hawk system and a Honeywell Autoflame proposal. They selected BoilerOptimizer based on:

| Criteria | Requirement | BoilerOptimizer Advantage |
|----------|-------------|---------------------------|
| ROI | <18 month payback | 6-month projected payback |
| Predictive | Advance failure warning | 30-90 day prediction capability |
| Ease of Use | Minimal operator training | Intuitive dashboard, 4-hour training |
| Integration | Work with existing Hawk | Full compatibility via OPC |

### Implementation Scope

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Boilers Connected | 4 x 60 MMBtu/hr Cleaver-Brooks |
| Instrumentation Added | 4 CO analyzers, stack temp sensors |
| Integration | OPC connection to Hawk, Wonderware historian |
| Timeline | 7 weeks (2 weeks ahead of schedule) |

### Key Use Cases

**Use Case 1: Dynamic O2 Optimization**
Previous fixed O2 setpoint of 4.5% was replaced with AI-driven dynamic control. The system adjusts O2 target based on load, ambient temperature, and humidity - reducing excess air by an average of 1.8 percentage points.

**Use Case 2: Multi-Boiler Load Balancing**
Instead of simple lead-lag sequencing, BoilerOptimizer distributes load based on each boiler's efficiency curve at current conditions. This captured an additional 2.1% efficiency improvement during variable demand periods.

**Use Case 3: Tube Health Monitoring**
By correlating water chemistry trends, temperature patterns, and pressure signatures, the system provides early warning of tube stress - enabling planned interventions instead of emergency failures.

> **Customer Quote:**
> "The implementation was smoother than we expected. GreenLang's team understood food processing from day one - they knew about seasonal demand swings and CIP cycles without us explaining."
>
