> "Here's your boiler plant with each unit shown in real-time. Green means optimal operation, yellow indicates attention needed, red is critical. Right now, you can see Boiler 2 is in yellow.
>
> [Point to KPI banner]
> "These top-level KPIs give you instant insight:
> - Plant efficiency: 86.3% - that's the weighted average across all running boilers
> - Steam production: 42,000 lbs/hr - meeting current demand
> - Cost per 1,000 lbs: $8.42 - tracking fuel cost efficiency
> - CO2 emissions: real-time carbon footprint
>
> [Point to efficiency trend]
> "This trend shows your efficiency over the past 24 hours. See this dip at 6 AM? Our system detected a 2% efficiency drop on Boiler 1 and automatically generated an alert."

### Alert Management

**Screen:** Alert console

**Script:**
> "Traditional boiler alarms flood operators with nuisance alerts. BoilerOptimizer uses AI to prioritize what matters.
>
> [Show alert list]
> "Alerts are categorized by severity and impact. Each one includes:

>
> [Show efficiency waterfall chart]
> "This waterfall shows where your heat is going:
> - Useful steam output: 84.2%
> - Stack losses (dry gas): 8.1%
> - Stack losses (moisture): 5.2%
> - Blowdown losses: 1.5%
> - Radiation losses: 1.0%
>
> Our AI continuously analyzes each loss component and identifies opportunities. See this stack loss at 8.1%? With optimal combustion, that should be 6.5%. That's $28,000 per year on this boiler alone."

### O2 Trim Optimization

**Screen:** O2 optimization display

**Script:**
> "Traditional O2 trim runs at a fixed setpoint - typically 3-4% oxygen in flue gas. But optimal O2 varies with load, ambient conditions, and fuel quality.
>
> [Show O2 optimization curve]
> "Watch what happens as load changes:
> - At full load, our AI recommends 2.8% O2 for peak efficiency
> - At 50% load, optimal shifts to 3.5% O2
> - In cold weather, we adjust for increased air density
>
> [Show before/after comparison]
> "This customer was running fixed 4% O2. We optimized dynamically and achieved 2.5% efficiency improvement - $67,000 annual savings on a single boiler."

### Live Optimization Demo

**Screen:** Real-time optimization recommendations

**Script:**
> "Let me show you live optimization in action.
>
> [Show current state]
> "Boiler 1 is currently at 72% load with 4.1% O2. Our AI model says optimal is 3.4% O2 at this load.
>
> [Show recommendation]
> "Here's the recommendation: Reduce O2 setpoint to 3.4%. Expected benefit: 0.8% efficiency gain, $350/month on this unit.
>
> [Show simulation]
> "Before you make any change, you can simulate the impact. Watch - I'll run a what-if at 3.4% O2...
>
> The simulation confirms: efficiency increases from 83.8% to 84.6%, stack temperature drops 12 degrees, and CO stays well below limits. Safe, validated optimization."

### Multi-Boiler Load Optimization

**Screen:** Multi-boiler efficiency curves

**Script:**
> "When you have multiple boilers, the question is: which ones should run and at what load?
>
> [Show efficiency curves]
> "Each boiler has a different efficiency profile. Boiler 1 is most efficient at 75% load. Boiler 2 peaks at 80%. Boiler 3, your oldest unit, is best at 65%.
>
> [Show load allocation]
> "Traditional sequencing is simple: lead/lag based on demand. Our AI optimizes continuously:
> - Current demand: 38,000 lbs/hr
> - Traditional allocation: Boiler 1 at 80%, Boiler 2 at 60%
> - Optimized allocation: Boiler 1 at 75%, Boiler 2 at 70%
> - Savings: 1.2% efficiency gain across the plant
>
> That optimization alone is worth $40,000 per year for a typical 4-boiler plant."

## Common Demo Questions

### Technical Questions

**Q: Do you replace our existing controls?**
> "No - we work alongside your existing BMS and controls. We read data from your systems and provide optimization recommendations. You can implement manually or we can write setpoints back automatically."

**Q: What instrumentation do we need?**
> "Minimum: O2 analyzer, fuel flow, steam flow, and standard temperatures/pressures. For full value, we recommend adding CO analyzer. We can assess your current instrumentation during a site visit."

**Q: How do you handle multiple fuel types?**
> "BoilerOptimizer supports multi-fuel operation - natural gas, oil, propane, biogas. The system automatically adjusts optimization parameters when fuel type changes."

### Business Questions

**Q: What's the implementation timeline?**
> "Typical implementations are 5-10 weeks from contract to go-live. Simpler installations with existing instrumentation can be faster."

**Q: What does pricing look like?**
> "Pricing is based on number of boilers and edition. For [X] boilers, you'd be looking at approximately $[X] per month. We also offer gain-share pricing tied to verified savings."

**Q: What if we don't see the savings?**
> "We define success criteria in the pilot. If we don't identify meaningful savings opportunity, you don't proceed. Once live, our performance guarantee commits to minimum efficiency improvement."
