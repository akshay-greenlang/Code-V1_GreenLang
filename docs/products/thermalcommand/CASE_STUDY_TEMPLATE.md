# GULF COAST PETROCHEMICAL: $4.2M Annual Savings with ThermalCommand

**Industry:** Oil & Gas Refining
**Location:** Houston, Texas
**Company Size:** $8B Revenue, 3,500 Employees
**ThermalCommand Edition:** Enterprise
**Modules:** Steam Analytics, Furnace Performance, Predictive Maintenance

---

## Executive Summary

Gulf Coast Petrochemical, one of the largest independent refiners in the United States, implemented ThermalCommand to optimize thermal efficiency across their 250,000 BPD refinery. Within 12 months, they achieved $4.2 million in annual energy savings, reduced unplanned downtime by 45%, and cut CO2 emissions by 28,000 tons per year.

**Key Results:**

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Thermal Energy Costs | $28M/year | $23.8M/year | $4.2M savings (15%) |
| Unplanned Downtime | 180 hours/year | 99 hours/year | 45% reduction |
| CO2 Emissions | 280,000 tons/year | 252,000 tons/year | 10% reduction |

---

## Customer Profile

### Company Overview

Gulf Coast Petrochemical operates a 250,000 barrel-per-day refinery on the Houston Ship Channel, producing gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and petrochemical feedstocks. As one of the most complex refineries in North America, the facility processes both light and heavy crudes, requiring extensive thermal processing capabilities.

### Thermal Operations

| Characteristic | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Thermal Assets | 85 process heaters, 12 boilers, 200+ heat exchangers |
| Annual Energy Spend | $28 million |
| Primary Fuels | Refinery fuel gas, natural gas |
| Key Processes | Crude distillation, FCC, reforming, hydrotreating |
| Geographic Scope | Single site, 2,000 acres |

---

## The Challenge

### Business Context

With refining margins under pressure and increasingly stringent environmental regulations, Gulf Coast Petrochemical needed to reduce operating costs while meeting aggressive sustainability targets. Their 2030 emissions reduction commitment required a 30% reduction in Scope 1 emissions, with thermal operations representing 70% of the total.

### Operational Challenges

- Rising energy costs consuming 15% of operating budget
- Process heaters operating 8-12% below optimal efficiency
- 180 hours of unplanned downtime annually from thermal equipment failures
- No visibility into real-time efficiency across 300+ thermal assets
- Manual optimization taking 40+ engineer-hours per week
- Emissions reporting requiring 2 weeks of manual effort quarterly

### Previous Approaches

The refinery had deployed a major DCS vendor's analytics platform three years prior, but achieved only 3% energy improvement. "We spent $2 million on the implementation and never got close to the promised results," noted the VP of Operations. "The platform was too generic - it didn't understand refinery thermal processes."

> **Customer Quote:**
> "We were spending millions on energy we didn't need to spend, but we couldn't see where the waste was happening. Our operators were flying blind."
>
> -- James Morrison, VP Operations, Gulf Coast Petrochemical

## The Solution

### Why ThermalCommand

Gulf Coast Petrochemical evaluated three solutions over 6 months, including offerings from Emerson and Honeywell. ThermalCommand won based on:

**Key Selection Criteria:**

| Criteria | Customer Requirement | ThermalCommand Capability |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Thermal Expertise | Deep refinery heater knowledge | 50+ refinery customers, heater-specific ML models |
| Time to Value | Results in <6 months | 90-day POC delivered 8% savings on pilot heaters |
| Integration | Work with existing DeltaV DCS | Certified OPC-UA integration with DeltaV |
| AI Capabilities | Predictive maintenance | 7-14 day failure prediction with 95% accuracy |

### Implementation Scope

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Assets Connected | 297 thermal assets (85 heaters, 12 boilers, 200 exchangers) |
| Data Points | 45,000 |
| Modules Deployed | Steam Analytics, Furnace Performance, Predictive Maintenance |
| Integration Points | DeltaV DCS, OSIsoft PI, SAP PM |
| Users | 120 (operators, engineers, managers) |

### Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Activities |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Discovery | 4 weeks | Data assessment, process mapping, success criteria |
| Deployment | 6 weeks | Edge gateway install, DCS integration, cloud setup |
| Commissioning | 3 weeks | Model training, validation, user training |
| Optimization | 8 weeks | Model tuning, workflow integration, baseline |
| **Total** | **21 weeks** | |

### Key Use Cases

**Use Case 1: Process Heater Optimization**
ThermalCommand's Furnace Performance module monitors all 85 process heaters continuously, identifying combustion inefficiencies and recommending air-fuel ratio adjustments. The system detected that 60% of heaters were running with excess oxygen above optimal levels, wasting $180,000 monthly.

**Use Case 2: Steam System Balancing**
The Steam Analytics module optimized steam header pressures and identified 12 failed steam traps that were wasting 15,000 lbs/hr of steam. Annual savings: $420,000.

**Use Case 3: Predictive Maintenance for Induced Draft Fans**
Predictive models detected bearing degradation on a critical ID fan 18 days before failure, enabling planned repair during a scheduled turnaround. Avoided cost: $1.2 million in lost production.

> **Customer Quote:**
> "The implementation was faster than any analytics project we've done. GreenLang's team understood our processes from day one - we weren't teaching them refinery 101."
>
