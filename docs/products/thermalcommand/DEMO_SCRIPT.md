>
> [Point to asset map]
> "This is your plant layout with every thermal asset color-coded by status - green is optimal, yellow needs attention, red is critical. Right now you can see Furnace 12 is in yellow status."
>
> [Click on Furnace 12]
> "One click and I see exactly what's happening - efficiency is down 4% from baseline, excess air is running high, and there's an optimization opportunity worth $12,000 per month."

### Alert Management

**Screen:** Alert console

**Script:**
> "Traditional alarm systems flood operators with thousands of alerts daily. ThermalCommand uses AI to prioritize what matters.
>
> [Show alert list]
> "See how alerts are categorized: Critical, Warning, and Info. Each alert includes context - what's happening, why it matters, recommended action, and estimated impact."
>
> [Click on specific alert]
> "This alert shows Boiler 3 is running 6% below expected efficiency. The AI has already diagnosed the likely cause - economizer fouling - and recommends scheduling cleaning within 14 days. If ignored, we estimate $45,000 in excess fuel costs and potential tube failure."

### Mobile Access (Optional)

>
> [Point to anomaly chart]
> "See this trend for Heater 7? The blue band is what our AI predicts based on current operating conditions - load, ambient temperature, fuel quality. The actual performance in orange is tracking below prediction.
>
> Our AI detected this anomaly 3 days ago - before it would trigger any traditional alarm. We estimate this early detection saves $30,000 in avoided unplanned downtime."

### Root Cause Analysis

**Screen:** Root cause analysis interface

**Script:**
> "When something goes wrong, finding the root cause manually takes hours or days. ThermalCommand does it in minutes.
>
> [Click 'Analyze' on an anomaly]
> "Watch this - I'm asking the AI to analyze why Furnace 4's efficiency dropped yesterday.
>
> [Show results after 30 seconds]
> "In 30 seconds, we have our answer: The root cause is a 15% increase in excess air, correlated with a draft damper that's stuck partially open. Confidence level: 94%. The AI even shows the evidence - look at how the damper position correlates with the efficiency drop."

### Optimization Recommendations

**Screen:** Optimization recommendations

**Script:**
> "Now let's see how ThermalCommand helps you optimize continuously.
>
> [Show recommendations list]
> "These are AI-generated optimization opportunities ranked by impact. Let me walk through the top three:
>
> [Click recommendation 1]
> "Number one: Adjust combustion air trim on Heaters 1-5. The AI has identified that current air-fuel ratios are conservative by 8%. Implementing this change would save $180,000 annually with zero capital investment.
>
> [Click recommendation 2]
> "Number two: Shift production to off-peak hours for Batch Ovens. Our load scheduling AI found that 30% of batch operations could move to lower-cost energy periods. Annual savings: $95,000.
>
> [Click recommendation 3]
> "Number three: Schedule heat exchanger cleaning for E-105. Fouling has reached the economic cleaning threshold. Every day of delay costs $400."

### Predictive Maintenance

**Screen:** Predictive maintenance dashboard

**Script:**
> "Beyond optimization, ThermalCommand predicts equipment failures before they happen.
>
> [Show prediction chart]
> "See this forecast for Boiler 2's induced draft fan? Our AI analyzes vibration patterns, temperature trends, and hundreds of other variables to predict remaining useful life.
>
> Current prediction: 87% probability of bearing failure in 21 days. That's 3 weeks of advance warning to plan the repair during scheduled downtime instead of an emergency shutdown.
>
> [Show maintenance schedule]
> "Based on all predictions, ThermalCommand generates an optimized maintenance schedule - balancing risk, cost, and production impact."

### Key Points to Emphasize

- AI detects problems before traditional alarms
- Root cause analysis in minutes, not hours

>
> The power of the digital twin is what-if analysis - testing operational changes virtually before implementing them in the real world."

### What-If Scenarios

**Screen:** Scenario builder

**Script:**
> "Let me show you a practical example. Your operations team wants to increase throughput on this furnace by 10%. Traditionally, you'd either try it and hope for the best, or spend weeks on engineering analysis.
>
> [Create scenario]
> "Watch - I'm creating a scenario: increase feed rate by 10%. The digital twin simulates the impact...
>
> [Show results]
> "Results in 5 seconds: 10% throughput increase is feasible, but tube metal temperatures will increase by 35F, reducing remaining tube life by 8 months. The twin recommends increasing cooling air flow by 15% to maintain current tube life.
>
> That's engineering analysis that would take 2 weeks, delivered in 5 seconds."
