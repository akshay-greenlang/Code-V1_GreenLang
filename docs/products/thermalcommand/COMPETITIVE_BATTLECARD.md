## 5. Competitive Win Strategies

### Strategy A: Land and Expand

1. **Land:** Win a single thermal use case (boiler optimization, furnace efficiency)
2. **Prove:** Demonstrate 15%+ energy savings in 90 days
3. **Expand:** Add assets, modules, sites based on proven ROI
4. **Displace:** Incumbent can't match our thermal-specific results

### Strategy B: Complement, Don't Compete

1. **Position:** "We integrate with your existing DCS/historian"
2. **Differentiate:** "We add thermal AI on top of your automation layer"
3. **Partner:** Work alongside incumbent, not against them
4. **Win:** Customer gets best of both worlds

### Strategy C: POC Challenge

1. **Propose:** Head-to-head POC with incumbent
2. **Define:** Clear success criteria (energy savings, time-to-value)
3. **Execute:** 4-6 week POC demonstrating our capabilities
4. **Win:** Let results speak for themselves

### Strategy D: Executive Value Selling

1. **Target:** CFO, COO, Sustainability Officer (not just VP Engineering)
2. **Message:** Energy savings, carbon reduction, shareholder value
3. **Proof:** ROI calculator, customer references, analyst reports
4. **Win:** Top-down mandate vs. bottom-up evaluation

## 6. Common Objections & Responses

### "We're happy with our current vendor"

**Response:** "That's great to hear. Most of our customers were happy with their DCS/historian vendors too - and still are. We complement them, we don't replace them. The question is: are you getting 15-25% thermal energy reduction? If not, we can add that value on top of what you have."

### "We don't have budget for another system"

**Response:** "I understand budget is tight. Here's the thing - ThermalCommand pays for itself in 3-6 months through energy savings. For a typical site, we're talking $1-5M in annual savings against a $200-500K annual investment. Would it help if I showed you our gain-share pricing where we only get paid based on verified savings?"

### "We're concerned about another vendor relationship"

**Response:** "Vendor management is a real concern. That's why we designed ThermalCommand to work through your existing systems - we read data from your Emerson/Honeywell/Siemens systems via OPC-UA. You don't need another control system relationship, just a thermal optimization partner."

### "Our IT/OT team is stretched too thin"

**Response:** "We hear that a lot. Our implementation is designed to minimize burden on your teams. We handle 90% of the work through our Professional Services team. Your team's involvement is typically 2-4 hours per week during implementation. After go-live, it's fully managed."

### "We want to build this internally"

**Response:** "That's a path some companies take. In our experience, internal builds take 3-5 years and $5M+ to reach the capability we offer today. And you're competing for data science talent against Google and Amazon. For 10% of that investment, you can have ThermalCommand live in 3 months. What's the opportunity cost of waiting 3-5 years?"

### "Your company is too small/new"

**Response:** "I appreciate the concern. A few things to consider: We have 150+ enterprise customers including [Fortune 500 names]. We're backed by [Tier 1 VCs] with $X in funding. And we offer contractual SLAs with escrow provisions. Would it help to speak with reference customers in your industry?"
