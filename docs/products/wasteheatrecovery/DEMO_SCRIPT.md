## Section 2: Opportunity Discovery (12 minutes)

### Thermal Map Overview

**Screen:** Facility thermal map

**Script:**
> "This is your facility's thermal profile - a complete picture of where heat flows and where opportunities exist.
>
> [Point to map visualization]
> "We've mapped every significant thermal stream in your facility:
> - Red streams are heat sources - exhaust, cooling, process discharge
> - Blue streams are heat sinks - your heating requirements
> - The thickness shows energy magnitude
>
> [Highlight a specific stream]
> "See this flue gas stream from your furnaces? 800F, 50,000 CFM - that's approximately 15 million BTUs per hour going up the stack. At $8 per million BTU, that's $120,000 of fuel value per month being wasted."

### Source-Sink Matching

**Screen:** AI opportunity finder

**Script:**
> "Traditional approaches require engineers to manually identify matches between heat sources and sinks. Our AI does this automatically.
>
> [Show source-sink matching interface]
> "The system has analyzed all your thermal streams and identified these matches:
>
> [Click on top opportunity]
> "Opportunity #1: Furnace exhaust to process preheat
> - Source: 800F furnace exhaust
> - Sink: Incoming process stream at 60F, needs heating to 350F
> - Recovery potential: 12 million BTU/hr
> - Annual savings: $960,000
> - Estimated capital: $400,000
> - Payback: 5 months
>
> The AI found this match because temperatures, flows, and timing align. It also verified no cross-contamination risk and adequate proximity."

### Pinch Analysis

**Screen:** Pinch analysis diagram

**Script:**
> "For a complete picture, we use pinch analysis - the gold standard for heat integration.
>
> [Show composite curves]
> "These curves show your facility's entire heating and cooling profile. The 'pinch point' - this narrow gap here - tells us the thermodynamic minimum energy your facility needs.
>
> Right now, you're using 45 million BTU/hr of external heating. The theoretical minimum is 28 million BTU/hr. That 17 million BTU/hr difference? That's your total recovery opportunity - worth $2.4 million annually.
>
> Our AI identified 78% of that potential is practically recoverable - $1.9 million per year."

### Key Points

- Complete thermal mapping of all streams
- AI-powered source-sink matching
- Thermodynamic pinch analysis
- Quantified opportunity sizing

## Section 3: Existing Equipment Optimization (10 minutes)

### Equipment Dashboard

**Screen:** Heat recovery equipment status

**Script:**
> "Most facilities already have some heat recovery - economizers, exchangers, preheaters. But how well are they performing?
>
> [Show equipment dashboard]
> "Here's your existing heat recovery equipment:
> - 3 economizers: averaging 78% effectiveness
> - 8 shell & tube exchangers: averaging 72% effectiveness
> - 2 air preheaters: averaging 81% effectiveness
>
> Design effectiveness for this equipment is typically 85-90%. That gap represents significant lost value."

### Performance Analysis

**Screen:** Individual equipment detail

**Script:**
> "Let's look at Economizer E-101.
>
> [Show performance trend]
> "Current effectiveness: 76% - down from 84% when it was commissioned. This trend shows it's been declining for 6 months.
>
> Our AI diagnosed the cause: approach temperature has increased from 25F to 45F, indicating tube fouling on the water side. Cleaning now would recover $4,200 per month in lost efficiency.
>
> [Show recommendation]
> "The system recommends scheduling cleaning within 14 days, during your upcoming maintenance window. Expected improvement: 8 percentage points, $50,000 annual savings."

### Optimization Recommendations

**Screen:** Optimization action list

**Script:**
> "Beyond cleaning schedules, we continuously optimize setpoints.
>
> [Show recommendations list]
> "These are current optimization opportunities across your recovery systems:
>
> 1. **Adjust economizer bypass**: Current 15% bypass is excessive for current load. Reducing to 5% saves $18,000/year.
>
> 2. **Rebalance heat pump staging**: Unit 2 is running at 85% while Unit 1 is at 40%. Better balancing improves combined COP by 12%.
>
> 3. **Increase condensate return temperature**: Current 180F target is conservative. 195F is safe and recovers additional 2 million BTU/hr.
>
> Each recommendation includes expected savings, implementation steps, and any risks."

### Key Points

- Real-time effectiveness monitoring
- AI-diagnosed performance issues
- Quantified optimization recommendations
- Fouling and degradation tracking

### Sensitivity Analysis

**Screen:** Sensitivity charts

**Script:**
> "Before committing capital, you want to understand the risks.
>
> [Show sensitivity analysis]
> "This shows how project economics change with key variables:
> - If fuel prices drop 20%, payback extends to 14 months - still attractive
> - If capacity utilization drops to 60%, payback is 16 months
> - Even in worst-case scenario, project is NPV-positive within 2 years
>
> The system automatically identifies what would make each project fail and tests those scenarios."

### Key Points

- Risk-adjusted project ranking
- Detailed economic analysis
- Sensitivity testing
- Implementation roadmaps

## Section 5: Carbon Tracking (5 minutes)

### Carbon Dashboard

**Screen:** Carbon tracking view

**Script:**
> "Every BTU of heat you recover is fuel you don't burn - and CO2 you don't emit.
>
> [Show carbon dashboard]
> "Your heat recovery systems are currently avoiding:
> - 2,450 tons CO2 per year from existing equipment
> - Potential additional 3,800 tons from identified projects
>
> At $50/ton (internal carbon price or EU ETS), that's $310,000 of carbon value - on top of the fuel savings."

### Verification and Reporting

**Screen:** Carbon report generator

**Script:**
> "For ESG reporting and potential carbon credit generation, you need verified, auditable data.
>
> [Show reporting tools]

## Common Questions

### Technical

**Q: What data do you need?**
> "Minimum: major stream temperatures and flows, fuel consumption data, existing equipment specs. Ideally: historian data, P&IDs, energy audit reports. We can work with whatever you have and identify gaps."

**Q: How do you integrate with our existing systems?**
> "We connect via OPC-UA to your historian or DCS for real-time data. We can also ingest batch data from Excel or CSV for initial analysis. No changes to your control systems required."

**Q: How accurate are the savings estimates?**
> "At assessment stage, +/- 20-30%. As we connect to real-time data, accuracy improves to +/- 10-15%. We always present ranges and verify with actual measurements."

### Business

**Q: What's the implementation timeline?**
> "Assessment: 2-8 weeks depending on scope. Platform deployment: 4-8 weeks after that. First optimization value typically within 30 days of go-live."

**Q: Who uses this day-to-day?**
> "Energy engineers for optimization and project identification. Operations for daily monitoring. Sustainability teams for carbon tracking. Executives for portfolio dashboards."

**Q: What if we don't have dedicated energy staff?**
> "Our platform is designed to be self-service, but we offer managed services where our team monitors and provides monthly recommendations if you prefer."
