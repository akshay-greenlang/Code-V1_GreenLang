# WasteHeatRecovery ROI Calculator

**Product Code:** GL-006 | **Version:** 2.0 | **Last Updated:** 2025-12-04

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides methodology for calculating Return on Investment (ROI) for WasteHeatRecovery implementations. The model addresses both platform value (optimization of existing systems) and project value (identification and implementation of new recovery opportunities).

---

## 1. ROI Framework

### Value Components

WasteHeatRecovery delivers value through two primary mechanisms:

| Value Type | Description | Typical Impact |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Platform Value** | Optimization of existing heat recovery equipment | 5-15% improvement |
| **Project Value** | Identification and implementation of new recovery projects | 30-60% of waste heat captured |

### ROI Formula

```
Platform ROI = (Annual Optimization Savings - Annual Platform Cost) / Platform Cost

Project ROI = (Annual Project Savings - Annual Operating Cost) / Project Capital

Combined ROI = (Total Annual Benefits - Total Annual Costs) / Total Investment
```

## 2. Platform Value Analysis

### 2.1 Existing Equipment Optimization

**Typical Optimization Improvements:**

| Equipment Type | Current Performance | Optimized Performance | Improvement |
|----------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| Economizers | 75-85% effectiveness | 85-92% effectiveness | 5-12% |
| Air Preheaters | 70-80% effectiveness | 80-88% effectiveness | 8-15% |
| Shell & Tube HX | 65-80% effectiveness | 80-90% effectiveness | 10-20% |
| Heat Pumps | 2.5-3.5 COP | 3.5-4.5 COP | 15-30% |
| Condensate Systems | 70-85% return | 90-95% return | 10-20% |

**Value Calculation:**

```
Annual Optimization Value = Current Recovery (MMBtu) x Improvement % x Fuel Price ($/MMBtu)
```

### 2.2 Operational Savings

| Savings Category | Typical Annual Value | Notes |
|------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Reduced Fouling Downtime | $20K-$100K | Better cleaning scheduling |
| Extended Equipment Life | $50K-$200K | Reduced thermal stress |
| Avoided Energy Waste | $100K-$500K | Bypass optimization |
| Labor Productivity | $25K-$75K | Automated monitoring |
| Compliance Documentation | $10K-$30K | Automated reporting |

### 3.3 Platform Role in Project Value

WasteHeatRecovery creates project value by:

1. **Finding Opportunities:** AI identifies recovery potential that manual analysis misses
2. **Optimizing Selection:** Economic ranking ensures best projects are prioritized
3. **Improving Accuracy:** Better data leads to better engineering and fewer surprises
4. **Accelerating Execution:** Pre-analysis reduces engineering time by 30-50%
5. **Maximizing Performance:** Ongoing optimization ensures projects hit targets

**Attribution Model:**
- Platform identifies and enables projects
- Typical attribution: 10-20% of project value credited to platform
- Conservative for ROI: credit 10% of project savings to platform
