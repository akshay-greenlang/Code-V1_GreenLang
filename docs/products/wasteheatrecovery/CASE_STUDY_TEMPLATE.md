# VALLEY CHEMICAL: $1.8M Annual Savings Through Waste Heat Optimization

**Industry:** Specialty Chemicals
**Location:** Baton Rouge, Louisiana
**Facility Type:** Specialty chemical manufacturing
**Annual Energy Spend:** $18 million
**WasteHeatRecovery Edition:** Professional

---

## Executive Summary

Valley Chemical, a specialty chemical manufacturer, implemented WasteHeatRecovery to optimize their thermal integration and identify new recovery opportunities. Within 18 months, they achieved $1.8 million in annual energy savings, implemented two major recovery projects, and reduced CO2 emissions by 8,500 tons annually.

**Key Results:**

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Heat Recovery Rate | 22% | 48% | +26 points |
| Annual Energy Cost | $18.0M | $16.2M | -$1.8M |
| CO2 Emissions | 95,000 tons/yr | 86,500 tons/yr | -9% |

---

## Customer Profile

### Company Overview

Valley Chemical operates a 200-acre specialty chemical complex producing intermediates for agricultural, pharmaceutical, and industrial applications. The facility includes multiple reactor systems, distillation columns, and finishing operations, with significant thermal requirements for heating and cooling.

### Thermal Operations

| Characteristic | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Primary Heat Sources | Reactor exotherms, distillation condensers, cooling water |
| Primary Heat Sinks | Feed preheat, reboilers, building heat |
| Existing Recovery Equipment | 12 shell & tube exchangers, 4 economizers |
| Annual Thermal Energy | 2.2 million MMBtu |

---

## The Challenge

### Business Context

Rising natural gas prices and aggressive corporate sustainability targets created urgency to reduce thermal energy consumption. A consultant study 3 years prior had identified opportunities, but recommendations were never fully implemented due to competing capital priorities and lack of ongoing visibility.

### Operational Challenges

- Existing heat recovery equipment operating 15-25% below design effectiveness
- No visibility into real-time recovery performance across the facility
- Consultant study recommendations becoming stale as operations changed
- Difficulty justifying capital for new recovery projects without current data
- Manual tracking of energy and emissions consuming engineering time

> **Customer Quote:**
> "We knew we were wasting heat - we could feel it walking through the plant. But we couldn't quantify it or prioritize where to invest."
> -- Robert Chen, Energy Manager, Valley Chemical

---

## The Solution

### Why WasteHeatRecovery

Valley Chemical selected WasteHeatRecovery after evaluating three options: re-engaging their previous consultant, deploying a generic energy management system, and WasteHeatRecovery. Key selection factors:

| Criteria | Requirement | WasteHeatRecovery Advantage |
|----------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Speed | Results within 90 days | 8-week assessment vs. 6-month consultant study |
| Continuity | Ongoing optimization | 24/7 monitoring vs. periodic consulting |
| Domain Expertise | Chemical industry knowledge | Purpose-built for process industries |
| Project Support | Engineering-ready analysis | Detailed economics and implementation plans |

### Implementation Scope

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Heat Streams Monitored | 156 |
| Equipment Optimized | 16 exchangers, 4 economizers |
| Projects Identified | 12 |
| Projects Implemented | 4 (to date) |

### Key Use Cases

**Existing Equipment Optimization:**
Within 60 days, the platform identified that 9 of 16 heat exchangers were operating with effectiveness below 70% due to fouling, suboptimal flow rates, or bypass issues. Targeted interventions recovered 22% average improvement - $380,000 annual value with minimal capital investment.

**Reactor Exotherm Recovery Project:**
The AI identified a match between reactor cooling (removing 8 million BTU/hr of reaction heat) and feed preheat requirements. Previous analysis had dismissed this due to temperature grade concerns, but WasteHeatRecovery identified a heat pump integration that made it economically viable. Project investment: $650,000. Annual savings: $520,000. Payback: 15 months.

**Distillation Column Integration:**
Pinch analysis revealed that Column A's condenser and Column B's reboiler could be thermally integrated, eliminating both cooling and heating requirements for significant portions of each column. This "double benefit" project delivered $430,000 annual savings on a $380,000 investment.

> **Customer Quote:**
> "The reactor heat project had been on our wish list for years. WasteHeatRecovery showed us how heat pumps changed the economics - suddenly a 15-month payback instead of 4 years."
> -- Maria Santos, Process Engineering Manager, Valley Chemical
