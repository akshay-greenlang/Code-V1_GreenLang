- **Drift:** Performance degrades between assessments

### Competitive Positioning

**When Competing:**

1. **Lead with Visibility:** "See every opportunity, every day - not just during annual audits."
2. **Lead with Scale:** "AI analyzes thousands of data points per minute. Humans can't match that."
3. **Lead with Consistency:** "Same analysis quality 24/7, regardless of staff turnover."
4. **Lead with Speed:** "Real-time identification, not post-mortem analysis."

**Objection Handling:**

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We have engineers who do this" | "Free them for higher-value work. Let AI handle continuous monitoring." |
| "We know our systems" | "Capture that knowledge in software. What happens when those experts retire?" |
| "Spreadsheets work fine" | "For looking backward. We show you what to do tomorrow." |
| "We just did an audit" | "Great baseline. Now maintain it with continuous optimization instead of letting it drift until next audit." |

## 6. Common Objections & Responses

### "We don't have enough waste heat to justify this"

**Response:** "That's what most customers think - until we assess. The average facility wastes 25-40% of thermal input. Even 'efficient' operations typically have 15-20% opportunity. A quick assessment can quantify your specific potential."

### "We already have heat recovery equipment"

**Response:** "Perfect - that's where we start. Most existing equipment operates 10-30% below potential due to fouling, suboptimal setpoints, and changing conditions. We optimize what you have, then find additional opportunities."

### "Our budget is for capital projects, not software"

**Response:** "We accelerate capital projects by identifying and prioritizing the best opportunities. And our platform costs are typically 2-5% of the project value we help create. Think of us as project identification and assurance, not just software."

### "This seems like a solution looking for a problem"

**Response:** "Let me share a data point: industrial facilities waste $20-50 billion annually in recoverable heat in North America alone. The question isn't whether the problem exists - it's how much applies to you. A quick assessment will tell us."

### "We tried this before and it didn't work"

**Response:** "What happened? Often it's one of three things: one-time study with no follow-through, generic software without domain expertise, or equipment vendor pushing their products. We address all three with continuous optimization, purpose-built AI, and vendor-agnostic recommendations."
