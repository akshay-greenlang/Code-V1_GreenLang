**NARRATION:**
"Before we dive into features, let's understand why compliance matters.

Process heat equipment operates at extreme temperatures, often with combustible materials. Without proper safeguards, the consequences can be severe - from equipment damage to personnel injuries.

Regulatory standards exist to prevent these incidents. They represent decades of industry learning and best practices.

But compliance isn't just about avoiding penalties. It protects your people, your equipment, and your business continuity.

GreenLang supports three key standards in process heat operations.

ISA 18.2 provides guidelines for alarm management - ensuring operators receive the right alarms, at the right priority, at the right time.

NFPA 86 covers furnace and oven safety - from combustion safeguards to ventilation requirements.

And OSHA Process Safety Management establishes requirements for hazard analysis, procedures, and training.

Let's see how GreenLang helps you meet these requirements."

**NARRATION:**
"The GreenLang compliance dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of your compliance status.

At the top, you see an overall compliance score. This aggregates multiple factors into a single metric. Green indicates good standing. Yellow means attention needed. Red indicates compliance issues requiring immediate action.

Below this, individual standards are shown with their own status indicators.

Let's look at the ISA 18.2 section. You can see metrics for alarm rate, standing alarm count, and stale alarms. Green checkmarks indicate metrics within acceptable ranges.

The NFPA 86 section shows combustion safety status, purge verification, and flame monitoring status.

Clicking on any section expands it to show detailed metrics and any issues requiring attention.

The timeline at the bottom shows compliance history. You can identify patterns - like weekly degradations - that might indicate systematic issues."

### SCENE 4: ISA 18.2 Alarm Management (5:30 - 10:00)

**VISUAL:**
- Alarm rationalization interface
- Priority distribution chart
- Alarm analysis reports

**NARRATION:**
"ISA 18.2 is the standard for alarm management. GreenLang provides comprehensive support for ISA 18.2 requirements.

The first element is alarm rationalization. Every alarm in your system should be justified and documented. GreenLang maintains this documentation in the alarm database.

For each alarm, you can record its cause, consequence, operator response, and priority justification. This is essential for audits.

The priority analysis shows the distribution of alarms by priority level. ISA 18.2 recommends specific distributions - roughly 5% critical, 15% high, 30% medium, and the rest low or advisory.

If your distribution is skewed - too many critical alarms, for example - GreenLang flags this for review.

The alarm metrics report tracks key performance indicators.

Average alarms per hour should typically be below 6. GreenLang calculates this automatically and alerts if it's exceeded.

Standing alarms - alarms active for more than 24 hours - should ideally be zero. Each standing alarm is listed with its duration.

Stale alarms - configured but never active - may indicate sensors or conditions that no longer exist.

Chattering alarms - those activating repeatedly in short periods - are identified for re-tuning.

You can generate ISA 18.2 compliance reports with one click. These are formatted for regulatory review and include all required documentation."

**ACTION:**
- Show alarm rationalization database
- Display alarm documentation fields
- Show priority distribution chart
- Display alarm metrics (alarms/hour, standing, stale)
- Generate compliance report

### SCENE 5: NFPA 86 Furnace Safety (10:00 - 14:00)

**VISUAL:**
- Furnace safety dashboard
- Combustion safeguard status
- Purge monitoring

**NARRATION:**
"NFPA 86 is the standard for furnace and oven safety. GreenLang monitors key NFPA 86 requirements continuously.

The furnace safety dashboard shows real-time status of combustion safeguards.

Flame detection status indicates whether burner flames are detected. Loss of flame triggers appropriate safety responses.

The purge timer shows status of pre-ignition purge cycles. NFPA 86 requires furnaces be purged of combustible gases before ignition. GreenLang verifies purge completion and duration.

Ventilation status confirms exhaust systems are operating. Adequate ventilation prevents combustible gas accumulation.

Safety interlock status shows the state of all safety circuits. Any bypassed or defeated interlock is flagged.

The temperature limit monitoring ensures equipment doesn't exceed design temperatures. GreenLang tracks both process and skin temperatures.

Let's look at the event log. Every safety-relevant event is logged with timestamp, details, and operator actions. This creates the audit trail NFPA 86 requires.

For any equipment, you can view its compliance status, maintenance history, and any open safety items."

**ACTION:**

- Hazard analysis documentation
- Training records integration

**NARRATION:**
"OSHA Process Safety Management applies to facilities handling hazardous materials. GreenLang helps manage several PSM elements.

The PSM dashboard tracks compliance across the 14 PSM elements. Green indicates documented and current. Yellow means review needed. Red indicates gaps.

Process hazard analysis documentation is stored and tracked. You can link hazards to specific agents and alarms, creating traceability from risk assessment to operational controls.

Operating procedures are versioned and controlled. GreenLang ensures operators have access to current procedures and can link procedures to specific process conditions.

The training module tracks operator qualifications. You can see who is certified for which equipment and when recertification is needed.

Management of change tracks modifications to equipment and procedures. Before any change is implemented, the impact assessment is documented.

Incident investigation records are maintained with root cause analysis and corrective actions. GreenLang can link incidents to specific process data for detailed analysis.

The pre-startup safety review checklist ensures all safety requirements are verified before equipment returns to service after maintenance or modification."
