### SCENE 2: The Challenge (0:30 - 1:30)

**VISUAL:**
- Split screen: operator at control panel / complex process displays
- Animated graphics showing energy costs rising
- Statistics overlay

**NARRATION:**
"Industrial process heat accounts for over 70% of manufacturing energy consumption worldwide. Managing these systems efficiently while maintaining safety and quality is increasingly challenging.

Operators face complex decisions across multiple variables. Energy costs continue to rise. And regulatory requirements for safety and emissions grow more stringent each year.

Traditional control systems simply weren't designed for this level of complexity. That's where GreenLang comes in."

**ACTION:**
- Display statistics: "70% of industrial energy" with animated graph
- Show rising energy cost chart
- Flash regulatory icons (NFPA 86, ISA 18.2, OSHA PSM)

### SCENE 3: What is GreenLang? (1:30 - 3:00)

**VISUAL:**
- GreenLang platform overview diagram
- Animated components highlighting each layer

**NARRATION:**
"GreenLang is an AI-powered platform designed specifically for process heat management. It combines advanced machine learning with deep industry expertise to help you optimize operations, ensure safety, and reduce costs.

At its core, GreenLang uses intelligent agents - specialized AI modules that continuously monitor, analyze, and optimize your process heat systems.

These agents work together through our orchestration layer, coordinating actions across your entire operation. And our machine learning engine provides predictions, anomaly detection, and optimization recommendations."

**ACTION:**
- Animate the architecture diagram layer by layer
- Highlight: Agent Layer, Orchestration Layer, ML Engine, Infrastructure

### SCENE 4: Key Benefits (3:00 - 5:00)

**VISUAL:**
- Four benefit cards appearing one by one
- Customer testimonial video clips (optional)

**NARRATION:**
"GreenLang delivers four key benefits to your operation.

First, energy efficiency. Our AI optimization typically reduces energy consumption by 15 to 30 percent, with some customers seeing even greater improvements.

Second, safety compliance. GreenLang continuously monitors your systems against standards like ISA 18.2, NFPA 86, and OSHA PSM, helping you maintain compliance automatically.

Third, predictive maintenance. By analyzing patterns in your data, GreenLang predicts equipment issues before they cause unplanned downtime - typically reducing downtime by 40 percent or more.

And fourth, operational excellence. With intelligent insights and recommendations, your operators can make better decisions, faster."

**ACTION:**
- Display each benefit card with icon and key metric:
  - Energy Efficiency: 15-30% reduction
  - Safety Compliance: 99.9% compliance rate
  - Predictive Maintenance: 40% less downtime
  - Operational Excellence: 20% productivity improvement

### SCENE 5: How It Works (5:00 - 7:00)

**VISUAL:**
- Animated data flow diagram
- Screen recording of real-time dashboard

**NARRATION:**
"Here's how GreenLang works in your facility.

First, data collection. GreenLang connects to your existing control systems through standard protocols like OPC-UA, Modbus, and MQTT. There's no need to replace your equipment.

This data flows into our processing engine, where it's cleaned, validated, and prepared for analysis.

Our machine learning models then analyze the data in real-time, detecting anomalies, predicting future conditions, and identifying optimization opportunities.

Finally, insights are delivered to operators through our intuitive dashboard, with alerts sent through multiple channels when action is needed."

**ACTION:**
- Animate data flow from sensors through each stage
- Show brief clips of actual dashboard updating in real-time

---

### SCENE 6: The Dashboard (7:00 - 10:00)

**VISUAL:**
- Full screen recording of GreenLang dashboard
- Cursor highlighting key areas

**NARRATION:**
"Let's take a quick tour of the GreenLang dashboard.

When you log in, you'll see the overview screen. This gives you an at-a-glance view of all your process heat zones, with current temperatures, status indicators, and any active alarms.

On the left, you'll find the navigation panel. From here, you can access detailed views of each zone, review alarms, generate reports, and access settings.

Each zone card shows the current temperature, setpoint, and status. Green indicates normal operation. Yellow indicates a warning condition. And red indicates an alarm requiring attention.

Below the zone cards, you'll see trend charts showing temperature history. This helps you spot patterns and identify potential issues before they become problems.

At the bottom of the screen, the status bar shows a summary of active alarms and overall system health."

**ACTION:**
- Move cursor to highlight each element as it's described
- Click through to show different views briefly
- Hover over zone cards to show tooltips

**NARRATION:**
"One of GreenLang's most powerful features is its machine learning engine.

Here in the predictions panel, you can see the AI forecasting temperature for the next several hours. Each prediction includes a confidence level, so you know how reliable the forecast is.

If the ML engine detects an anomaly, it will alert you with a clear explanation of what's unusual and possible causes.

And the optimization panel provides recommendations for improving efficiency - like adjusting setpoints or scheduling maintenance - all based on AI analysis of your actual operating data."

**ACTION:**
- Show prediction panel with confidence intervals
- Display an anomaly alert example
- Show optimization recommendation panel
