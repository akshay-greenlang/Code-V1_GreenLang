2. **Docker Release:** Multi-architecture build status unknown
3. **SBOM Completeness:** SBOM artifacts require validation

### LOW RISKS 🟢
1. **Version Alignment:** All version references confirmed as 0.2.0
2. **Python Compatibility:** >=3.10 requirement properly configured

## Action Items

### Immediate Actions (Today)
1. **Create Release Tag:** Generate v0.2.0-rc.0 release candidate tag
