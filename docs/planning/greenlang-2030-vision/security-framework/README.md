# GreenLang Security and Compliance Framework

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive security and compliance framework for GreenLang's sustainability platforms. Our approach implements defense-in-depth strategies with zero-trust architecture, ensuring regulatory compliance while maintaining operational efficiency.

## Framework Components

1. **Security Architecture** - Zero-trust network design with comprehensive IAM
2. **Compliance Frameworks** - SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA readiness
3. **Security Scanning** - Multi-layer automated security testing
4. **SBOM Management** - Complete software supply chain visibility
5. **Audit Trail System** - Immutable, blockchain-verified logging
6. **Penetration Testing** - Continuous security validation
7. **Incident Response** - 24/7 security operations
8. **Security Training** - Continuous security awareness program
