- **SEC Climate Disclosure**: Material climate risks in 10-K filings (U.S. public companies)
- **California SB253**: Scope 1-3 emissions disclosure for companies >$1B revenue doing business in CA
- **IFRS S1/S2**: Sustainability disclosure standards (global adoption starting 2024)

**CFO Concerns:**
- **Audit liability**: Sustainability data held to same standards as financial data
- **Internal controls**: SOX-like controls required for ESG data (audit trail, segregation of duties)
- **Data accuracy**: Restatement risk if carbon calculations incorrect
- **Integration**: ESG metrics must reconcile with financial reporting (cost allocation, capital planning)

**Source:** [IFRS Tools 2025](https://greenly.earth/en-gb/blog/company-guide/the-10-best-ifrs-tools-in-2025-and-how-to-choose-one), [SEC Climate Disclosure Rules](https://www.carbonchain.com/carbon-reporting/us-sec)

#### Preferred Solutions

**ERP Integration Priority:**
- **85% of CFOs** require native integration with existing ERP (SAP, Oracle, Workday, NetSuite)

#### Audit Requirements

**External Audit Expectations:**
- **Third-party assurance** required for CSRD (limited assurance 2024-2026, reasonable assurance from 2027)
- **Big 4 compatibility**: Systems must support Deloitte/PwC/KPMG/EY audit procedures
- **Data lineage**: Auditors trace every emission factor from source to report
- **Control testing**: Document approval workflows, calculation logic, data validation rules

**Internal Audit/Controls:**
- **SOX-style controls** for ESG data collection and reporting
- **Segregation of duties**: Data collectors ≠ data validators ≠ report approvers
- **Exception handling**: Flagging anomalies, data gaps, estimation methodologies
- **Change management**: Version control for calculation methodologies, emission factors

**Audit Cost Impact:**
- **With audit-ready software**: €50K-€100K annual audit costs (limited assurance)
- **Without audit-ready systems**: €150K-€300K annual audit costs (manual evidence gathering)
- **Reasonable assurance** (2027+): Add 50-100% to above costs

#### Build vs Buy Mindset

**CFO Build vs Buy Framework:**

**Buy When:**
- **Non-differentiating** functionality (compliance reporting is table stakes)
- **Time-sensitive** (regulatory deadline <12 months)
- **Audit requirements** (need proven, audited systems)
- **Resource constraints** (no internal sustainability/data science team)
- **Total Cost of Ownership**: Buy is 50-70% cheaper than build over 3 years

**Build When:**
- **Highly proprietary** methodologies (competitive advantage in carbon accounting)
- **Unique data sources** (IoT sensors, real-time monitoring not supported by vendors)
- **Massive scale** (cost per calculation becomes economically viable vs SaaS pricing)
- **Strategic capability** (sustainability as core business, not just compliance)

**Reality for Climate Software:**
- **95% of companies buy** for initial compliance (CSRD, SEC, CBAM deadlines too tight)
- **5% build** (mega-corps with >10K employees, >€10B revenue, dedicated sustainability teams)
- **Hybrid approach**: Buy for compliance reporting, build for competitive differentiation (product carbon footprints, customer-facing tools)

#### Compliance Guarantee Expectations

**What Legal Teams Want (But Can't Always Get):**

**Regulatory Coverage Guarantee:**
- **"If regulations change, you update software at no extra cost"**
  - Reality: Most vendors include in base contract, but major architecture changes = add-on fees
- **"If we get penalized for using your software incorrectly, you pay penalty"**
  - Reality: Vendors never accept this (indemnification only for software defects, not user error)

**What Legal Teams Can Negotiate:**

**Service Level Guarantees:**
- **Regulatory update timeline**: "New regulations incorporated within 6 months" (contractual commitment)
- **Uptime SLA**: 99.9% availability, credits if breached
- **Support response time**: <1 hour for critical issues (e.g., submission deadline approaching)

**Professional Services:**
- **Implementation guarantee**: "Go live by [deadline] or partial refund"
- **Audit support**: Vendor provides expert witness for external audits (additional fee)
- **Regulatory consulting**: Included hours of compliance advisory

**Risk Mitigation Clauses:**
- **Escrow agreement**: Source code held in escrow if vendor goes bankrupt
- **Data portability**: Guarantee data export in usable format if switch vendors
- **Termination for regulatory change**: Exit without penalty if vendor can't support new regulations

**Realistic Expectations:**
- Vendors provide **tools** to achieve compliance, not **guarantee** of compliance
- Customer responsible for **data accuracy** and **proper usage**
- Vendor responsible for **software functionality** and **regulatory coverage**
- **Shared responsibility model**: Customer + vendor + auditor working together

#### Build vs Buy Decisions

**Startup Build vs Buy Framework:**

**Build When:**
- **Core differentiation**: "This is our secret sauce" (e.g., novel carbon calculation methodology)
- **MVP speed**: Need quick POC, can code faster than integrate vendor API
- **Free/cheap alternatives**: Open source libraries available (GHG Protocol Python)
- **Investor demo**: Custom UI to showcase innovation vs generic tool

**Buy When:**
- **Non-core functionality**: Payment processing, email, auth (use Stripe, SendGrid, Auth0)
- **Regulatory complexity**: CSRD/SEC reporting (too risky to build in-house)
- **Time to market**: Investor/customer deadline in <3 months
- **Team bandwidth**: <5 developers (can't afford to build everything)

**Actual Behavior (Climate Startups):**
- **Year 1 (Pre-Seed/Seed)**: Build 80%, buy 20% (mostly developer tools: GitHub, AWS, Vercel)
- **Year 2-3 (Series A)**: Build 60%, buy 40% (add Stripe, Auth0, SendGrid, monitoring tools)
- **Year 4+ (Series B+)**: Build 40%, buy 60% (consolidate to platforms, buy compliance/audit tools)

**Switching Threshold:**
- Build in-house if: <€500/month to build + maintain
- Buy SaaS if: >€500/month cost, but saves >1 FTE engineering time
- ROI calculation: "Does buying this save me 2+ weeks of engineering time?" → If yes, buy

- **For each endpoint**:
  - Description (what it does)
  - Parameters (required/optional, data types, validation rules)
  - Code examples (all supported languages)
  - Response examples (success + error cases)
  - Try it (interactive API testing in browser)
- **Organization**: Group by resource (Emissions, Reports, Suppliers, etc.)
- **Search**: Instant search across all docs

**4. Guides & Concepts**
- **Concepts**: "Understanding Scope 3", "Emission factor databases", "CSRD requirements"
- **How-To Guides**: "Handle errors", "Pagination", "Webhooks", "Authentication"
- **Best Practices**: "Optimize API performance", "Data validation", "Security"
- **Quantity**: 20-30 guides covering core concepts

- **Breaking changes**: 6-month deprecation notice, clear migration path
- **RSS feed**: Subscribe to changelog updates

**Documentation Quality Standards:**

**Stripe/Twilio-Level Standards:**
- **Code comes first**: Show code example before prose explanation
- **Copy-paste ready**: Code examples are complete, runnable (not pseudocode)
- **Multi-language**: Every example in 5+ languages (use tabbed code blocks)
- **Error handling**: Show how to handle errors, not just happy path
- **Real-world examples**: Use realistic data (not "foo", "bar")
- **Tested code**: All code examples run in CI/CD (prevent broken examples)

**Twilio Research Findings:**
- **Completion rate 30% higher** if first step has <20 lines of code
- **Developers want code first**, then explanation (not vice versa)
- **Interactive components** (run code in browser) increase engagement 40%

**Documentation Metrics:**
- **Page views**: 100K+ monthly page views (measure popularity)
- **Time on page**: >2 minutes median (indicates usefulness)
- **Search queries**: Track what developers search for (indicates gaps)

#### Code Examples (Quantity, Quality)

**Quantity Requirements:**

**Minimum at Launch:**
- **Quickstart examples**: 6 languages (Python, JS, Java, C#, Go, Ruby)
- **API endpoint examples**: Every endpoint × 6 languages = 100+ examples
- **Use case examples**: 10 end-to-end tutorials with complete code repos
- **Integration examples**: 10 pre-built integrations (SAP, AWS, Azure, Workday, etc.)
- **Total**: 200+ code examples

**Ongoing:**
- **2 new tutorials/month**: New use cases, integration patterns
- **1 new integration/quarter**: Based on customer requests
- **Community contributions**: Accept PRs for new examples

**Quality Standards:**

**1. Complete & Runnable:**
- **Not pseudocode**: Real, working code that runs without modification
- **Includes setup**: Environment setup, dependencies, API key configuration
- **Sample data**: Realistic sample data included (CSVs, JSON files)
- **Expected output**: Show what output should look like

**Example (Bad):**
```python
# Pseudocode - NOT runnable
emissions = calculate_emissions(activity, amount)
print(emissions)
```

**Example (Good):**
```python
# Complete, runnable example
import os
from greenlang import Client

# Set up client with API key from environment variable
api_key = os.environ.get("GREENLANG_API_KEY")
client = Client(api_key=api_key)

# Calculate electricity emissions for 100 kWh in California
emissions = client.emissions.calculate(
    activity_type="electricity",
    amount=100,
    unit="kwh",
    region="US-CA"
)

print(f"CO2e: {emissions.co2e_kg} kg")
print(f"Source: {emissions.emission_factor_source}")
# Expected output:
# CO2e: 23.4 kg
# Source: EPA eGRID 2023 California
```

**2. Error Handling:**
- **Show common errors**: Authentication failed, rate limit, validation errors
- **Demonstrate retry logic**: Exponential backoff for transient errors
- **Helpful error messages**: Explain what went wrong, how to fix

**Example:**
```python
from greenlang import Client, GreenLangError, RateLimitError

client = Client(api_key="your_api_key")

try:
    emissions = client.emissions.calculate(
        activity_type="electricity",
        amount=100,
        unit="kwh",
        region="US-CA"
    )
except RateLimitError as e:
    print(f"Rate limit exceeded. Retry after {e.retry_after} seconds")
except GreenLangError as e:
    print(f"API error: {e.message}")
```

**3. Best Practices:**
- **Environment variables**: Never hardcode API keys
- **Pagination**: Show how to handle paginated results (loops)
- **Batching**: Efficient bulk operations (not 1000 individual API calls)
- **Caching**: Cache emission factors locally to reduce API calls

**4. Language Idiomatic:**
- **Python**: Use `requests` or `httpx`, async support, type hints
- **JavaScript**: Promises/async-await, ES6+ syntax
- **Java**: Spring Boot integration, builder patterns
- **Go**: Goroutines for concurrency, error handling idioms

**5. Testing Included:**
- **Unit tests**: Show how to test code using examples
- **Mocking**: How to mock API responses for testing
- **Fixtures**: Sample data for testing

**Code Example Repository Structure:**
