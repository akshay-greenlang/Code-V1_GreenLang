## PART 6: ORGANIZATIONAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### Core Principles for Scaling

#### 1. MISSION-DRIVEN CULTURE
**Why It Matters:** Climate tech attracts mission-driven talent willing to work harder for less pay if they believe in the mission.

**Implementation:**
- Every all-hands starts with impact metrics (CO2 reduced, reports filed, etc.)
- Quarterly "Climate Impact Days" - volunteer for climate projects
- Transparent climate dashboard showing customer impact
- Tie executive bonuses to mission metrics (20% weighting on climate impact)

---

#### 2. CUSTOMER-CENTRIC ORGANIZATION
**Why It Matters:** In B2B SaaS, customer success drives retention and expansion revenue.

**Implementation:**
- Every employee spends 1 day per quarter with customers (sales calls, support, onsite)
- Customer advisory board (10-15 strategic customers meet quarterly)
- Product roadmap driven by customer feedback (50% customer requests, 50% innovation)
- NPS tracked monthly, executive team reviews detractors within 24 hours

---

#### 3. TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE
**Why It Matters:** Platform companies live or die by product quality and developer experience.

**Implementation:**
- Engineering time allocation: 70% features, 20% tech debt, 10% innovation
- Quarterly "Hack Weeks" - engineers work on passion projects
- Internal "Tech Talks" - weekly learning sessions
- External thought leadership - engineers speak at conferences, write blog posts
- Open source contributions encouraged (20% of engineering work can be open source)

---

#### 4. RADICAL TRANSPARENCY
**Why It Matters:** Transparency builds trust, attracts top talent, and enables fast decision-making.

**Implementation:**
- Monthly all-hands with full financial transparency (ARR, burn, runway, metrics)
- Public salary bands (all employees know compensation ranges)
- OKRs published company-wide (everyone knows company and team goals)
- Anonymous "Ask Me Anything" with executives (monthly Slack AMA)
- Board deck shared with all employees (excluding sensitive M&A or fundraising terms)

---

#### 5. DIVERSITY & INCLUSION
**Why It Matters:** Climate change impacts everyone; solutions require diverse perspectives.

**Implementation:**
- Diversity targets: 40% women and non-binary, 30% underrepresented minorities by 2030
- Blind resume screening for all roles (remove names/schools)
- Diverse interview panels (every candidate sees diverse interviewers)
- ERGs (Employee Resource Groups): Women in Tech, Climate Justice, LGBTQ+, etc.
- Annual diversity report published publicly

---

## PART 7: RISK MITIGATION & CONTINGENCY PLANNING

### Key Organizational Risks

#### RISK #1: Key Person Dependency (Founders)
**Probability:** HIGH (early stage)
**Impact:** CRITICAL
**Mitigation:**
- Hire VP Engineering Q1 2026 (remove CTO as single point of failure)
- Document all systems and processes (knowledge transfer)
- Cross-train team members (no single person owns critical systems)
- Succession planning for founder roles by 2028

---

#### RISK #2: Talent Acquisition Failure
**Probability:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** HIGH
**Mitigation:**
- Build employer brand early (content, social media, conferences)
- Competitive compensation (75th percentile cash + equity)
- Referral program (20% of hires from referrals)
- Executive recruiter relationships for critical hires
- Expand geographic hiring (remote-first for some roles)

---

#### RISK #3: Culture Degradation During Rapid Scaling
**Probability:** HIGH (100 → 1000 people)
**Impact:** HIGH
**Mitigation:**
- Hire VP People/CHRO early (2028) to own culture
- Codify culture in writing (culture deck by 2027)
- Measure culture (quarterly employee engagement surveys, target 80%+ engagement)
- Leadership training for all managers (quarterly management training)
- Onboarding program emphasizes culture (30% of week 1 is culture)

---

#### RISK #4: International Expansion Complexity
**Probability:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Mitigation:**
- Hire regional leaders with local expertise (RVPs with 10+ years local experience)
- Legal and compliance support in each region (local counsel)
- Adapt go-to-market for local regulations and culture
- Phased expansion (Europe 2028, North America 2028, APAC 2029)

---

#### RISK #5: Executive Team Misalignment
**Probability:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** HIGH
**Mitigation:**

## PART 8: COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY & EQUITY STRATEGY

### Compensation Principles

#### 1. TARGET: 75TH PERCENTILE CASH + EQUITY
**Rationale:** Climate tech is competitive; need to attract top talent without overpaying.

**Implementation:**
- Use Option Impact or Pave for salary benchmarking
- Target: 75th percentile cash (base + bonus)
- Equity: Competitive with stage (0.05% → 2.5% depending on role and seniority)
- Review compensation annually against market

---

#### 2. EQUITY POOL STRATEGY
**Target Equity Pool:** 15-20% of fully diluted shares reserved for employees

**Allocation by Role:**
- **Founders:** 60-70% (split between co-founders)
- **First 10 Employees:** 10-15% (0.5-2% per person)
- **VP/C-Level (Pre-Series A):** 1-2.5%
- **VP/C-Level (Post-Series A):** 0.5-1.5%
- **Senior Managers:** 0.2-0.8%
- **Individual Contributors (Senior):** 0.05-0.3%
- **Individual Contributors (Mid-Level):** 0.01-0.1%

---

#### 3. VESTING SCHEDULE
**Standard Vesting:**
- 4-year vest with 1-year cliff (industry standard)
- Quarterly vesting after cliff
- No acceleration unless change of control + termination (double-trigger)

**Executive Vesting:**
- Same 4-year vest, but may negotiate shorter cliff (6 months for C-level)
- Partial acceleration for VP+ level (50% vest on change of control)

| **Founding (2024)** | $5M | - | - | 100% | 0% | 0% |
| **Pre-Seed (2025)** | $10M | $2M | 20% | 70% | 10% | 20% |
