## Executive Summary

**Version:** 1.0 | **Date:** January 26, 2026 | **Status:** APPROVED

## The Problem

Organizations worldwide face an urgent, complex challenge: **measuring, reducing, and reporting greenhouse gas emissions** while navigating a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape.

Current approaches fail because:
- **Consultants are expensive** ($500K-$2M per project) and slow (3-6 months)
- **Generic AI tools hallucinate** - dangerous for compliance and audit
- **Point solutions don't integrate** - siloed data, manual reconciliation
- **No reproducibility** - results can't be verified or replicated

---

## The Solution: GreenLang Climate OS

**GreenLang** is an **agentic runtime + domain-specific language (DSL)** that compiles problem specifications into deterministic multi-agent graphs where each specialist agent performs one job extremely well.

### How It Works

```
Problem Spec (DSL)                Multi-Agent Graph              Audit-Ready Outputs
┌──────────────────┐             ┌─────────────────┐            ┌──────────────────┐
│ • Assets         │             │  DATA → VALIDATE │            │ • Emissions      │
│ • Data Sources   │  ──COMPILE──▶   ↓              │ ──EXECUTE──▶ • Roadmaps       │
│ • Standards      │             │  CALCULATE → PLAN│            │ • Finance/TCO    │
│ • Constraints    │             │        ↓         │            │ • Procurement    │
└──────────────────┘             └──REPORT → AUDIT──┘            │ • XBRL/iXBRL     │
                                                                  └──────────────────┘
