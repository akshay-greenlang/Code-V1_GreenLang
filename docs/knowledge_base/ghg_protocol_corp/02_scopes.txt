SCOPE 1, 2, AND 3 EMISSIONS: DEFINITIONS, BOUNDARIES, AND EXAMPLES
=============================================================================

1. SCOPE DEFINITIONS OVERVIEW

The GHG Protocol classifies emissions into three scopes to help organizations comprehensively account for their greenhouse gas emissions across the value chain.

SCOPE 1: Direct GHG emissions
- Occur from sources owned or controlled by the company
- Examples: Combustion in boilers, furnaces, vehicles; process emissions

SCOPE 2: Indirect GHG emissions from purchased energy
- Result from generation of purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heating, or cooling
- Physically occur at facility where energy is generated

SCOPE 3: Other indirect GHG emissions
- Consequence of company activities but occur from sources not owned/controlled by company
- Include upstream and downstream value chain emissions

=============================================================================
2. SCOPE 1: DIRECT EMISSIONS (MANDATORY REPORTING)
=============================================================================

2.1 DEFINITION
Direct greenhouse gas emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the reporting entity.

2.2 SCOPE 1 EMISSION SOURCES

A) STATIONARY COMBUSTION
Burning of fuels in stationary equipment:
- Boilers (steam generation)
- Furnaces (process heating)
- Generators (backup power)
- Incinerators (waste treatment)
- Ovens, kilns, dryers

Common Fuels:
- Natural gas, fuel oil, diesel, coal, propane, biomass

Calculation Method:
Emissions (tons CO2e) = Fuel Consumed (units) × Emission Factor (tons CO2e/unit)

Example - Natural Gas Boiler:
Annual consumption: 100,000 therms
Emission factor: 0.0053 tons CO2/therm (EPA)
Emissions = 100,000 therms × 0.0053 tons/therm = 530 tons CO2

B) MOBILE COMBUSTION
Burning of fuels in transportation equipment owned/controlled:
- Company-owned vehicles (cars, trucks, forklifts)
- Company-owned aircraft
- Company-owned ships and boats
- Construction equipment
- Agricultural equipment

Calculation Method:
Option 1 (Fuel-based): Fuel consumed × Emission factor
Option 2 (Distance-based): Distance traveled × Fuel economy × Emission factor

Example - Fleet Vehicles:
20 vehicles, 15,000 miles/year each, 20 MPG average
Total miles: 20 × 15,000 = 300,000 miles
Fuel consumed: 300,000 / 20 = 15,000 gallons gasoline
Emission factor: 8.89 kg CO2/gallon (EPA)
Emissions = 15,000 gallons × 8.89 kg/gallon = 133,350 kg = 133.4 tons CO2

C) FUGITIVE EMISSIONS
Intentional or unintentional releases:
- Refrigerant leakage (HVAC, chillers, refrigerators)
- Natural gas leakage from pipes/equipment
- SF6 from electrical equipment
- CO2 from fire suppression systems

High GWP gases make fugitive emissions significant despite small masses.

Example - HVAC Refrigerant Leak:
Refrigerant: R-134a (HFC)
Annual leakage: 10 kg
GWP of R-134a: 1,530 (IPCC AR6)
Emissions = 10 kg × 1,530 / 1,000 = 15.3 tons CO2e

D) PROCESS EMISSIONS
Chemical or physical processes not involving combustion:
- Cement production: CaCO3 → CaO + CO2
- Steel production: Blast furnace reactions
- Aluminum production: Anode consumption
- Chemical manufacturing: Various reactions
- Pulp and paper: Black liquor combustion

Example - Cement Production:
Clinker produced: 100,000 tons/year
Process emission factor: 0.52 tons CO2 per ton clinker
Emissions = 100,000 tons × 0.52 = 52,000 tons CO2

2.3 SCOPE 1 EXCLUSIONS
- Biogenic CO2 from biomass combustion (reported separately, not in scopes)
- Emissions from facilities not owned/controlled under chosen boundary approach
- Emissions from employee commuting (Scope 3)

=============================================================================
3. SCOPE 2: INDIRECT EMISSIONS FROM PURCHASED ENERGY (MANDATORY)
=============================================================================

3.1 DEFINITION
Indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heating, cooling, or compressed air consumed by the reporting company.

Key principle: Scope 2 emissions physically occur at the facility where the energy is generated, but are accounted for by the organization that consumes the energy.

3.2 SCOPE 2 EMISSION SOURCES

A) PURCHASED ELECTRICITY
Most significant Scope 2 source for most organizations.

Calculation Methods:

Location-Based Method (Mandatory):
Uses average emission intensity of grids where energy is consumed.

Emissions = Electricity Consumed (MWh) × Grid Emission Factor (tons CO2e/MWh)

Example - Office Building:
Annual electricity: 1,000 MWh
Grid emission factor (US average): 0.417 tons CO2/MWh (EPA eGRID)
Emissions = 1,000 MWh × 0.417 = 417 tons CO2

Market-Based Method (Optional):
Reflects emissions from specific energy suppliers or products chosen by company.

Example - With Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs):
Annual electricity: 1,000 MWh
500 MWh covered by RECs (0 emission factor)
500 MWh from grid (0.417 tons/MWh)
Emissions = 500 MWh × 0.417 = 208.5 tons CO2

B) PURCHASED STEAM, HEAT, OR COOLING
District energy systems or from third parties.

Example - District Steam:
Annual steam: 5,000 MMBtu
Supplier-specific emission factor: 0.07 tons CO2/MMBtu
Emissions = 5,000 MMBtu × 0.07 = 350 tons CO2

C) PURCHASED COMPRESSED AIR
Industrial facilities purchasing compressed air from third-party supplier.

3.3 QUALITY OF EMISSION FACTORS

Tier 1 (Highest Quality): Supplier-specific emission factors
- Actual generation mix from energy supplier
- Contractually specified energy products

Tier 2: Subnational grid averages
- State, provincial, or regional grid factors
- Better than national averages for heterogeneous countries

Tier 3: National grid averages
- Average emission intensity for entire country
- Adequate for initial inventories

Tier 4 (Lowest Quality): Multi-country regional averages
- Use only when country-specific data unavailable

Example Emission Factors by Region:
- US Average (eGRID 2023): 0.417 tons CO2/MWh
- California (CAMX): 0.223 tons CO2/MWh
- Wyoming (RMPA): 0.832 tons CO2/MWh
- Germany: 0.350 tons CO2/MWh
- France: 0.057 tons CO2/MWh (high nuclear)
- China: 0.581 tons CO2/MWh
- India: 0.708 tons CO2/MWh

3.4 RENEWABLE ENERGY AND RECs

Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin:
- Unbundled: Purchased separately from electricity
- Bundled: Included with renewable electricity contract
- Only reduce market-based Scope 2, not location-based

Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs):
- Long-term contracts for renewable electricity
- Can be physical or virtual (financial)
- Reduce market-based Scope 2 emissions

On-Site Renewable Generation:
- Solar PV, wind, geothermal on company property
- Zero Scope 1 emissions (no fuel combustion)
- Reduces Scope 2 if offsets purchased electricity

=============================================================================
4. SCOPE 3: VALUE CHAIN EMISSIONS (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)
=============================================================================

4.1 DEFINITION
All other indirect emissions that occur in the company's value chain, including both upstream and downstream emissions.

Scope 3 is typically the largest share of emissions for most companies (often 70-90% of total carbon footprint).

4.2 SCOPE 3 CATEGORIES (15 TOTAL)

UPSTREAM EMISSIONS (Categories 1-8):

Category 1: PURCHASED GOODS AND SERVICES
Extraction, production, and transportation of goods and services purchased.

Examples:
- Raw materials and components
- Office supplies and IT equipment
- Outsourced services (consulting, cleaning)

Calculation:
Spend-based: Purchase amount ($) × Emission factor (tons CO2e/$)
Supplier-specific: Quantity × Supplier emission factor
Average-data: Quantity × Industry average emission factor

Example - Paper Procurement:
Annual paper purchased: 50 tons
Emission factor: 1.2 tons CO2e per ton paper
Emissions = 50 tons × 1.2 = 60 tons CO2e

Category 2: CAPITAL GOODS
Extraction, production, and transportation of capital goods purchased (buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles).

Amortization approach: Spread emissions over useful life of asset.

Example - New Production Equipment:
Equipment cost: $1,000,000
Emission factor: 0.5 tons CO2e per $1,000 (machinery)
Useful life: 10 years
Annual emissions = ($1M × 0.5 tons/$1k) / 10 years = 50 tons CO2e/year

Category 3: FUEL AND ENERGY-RELATED ACTIVITIES (Not in Scope 1 or 2)
Upstream emissions from fuel and energy:
- Extraction, production, transportation of fuels
- Transmission and distribution (T&D) losses
- Generation of purchased electricity sold to end users

Example - T&D Losses:
Purchased electricity: 1,000 MWh
T&D loss factor: 5%
Grid emission factor: 0.417 tons CO2/MWh
Emissions = 1,000 MWh × 5% × 0.417 = 20.85 tons CO2e

Category 4: UPSTREAM TRANSPORTATION AND DISTRIBUTION
Transportation and distribution of products purchased (in vehicles not owned/controlled).

Includes:
- Inbound logistics from suppliers
- Third-party warehousing and distribution
- Retail storage

Category 5: WASTE GENERATED IN OPERATIONS
Disposal and treatment of waste generated in company operations (in facilities not owned/controlled).

Example - Landfilled Waste:
Annual waste to landfill: 100 tons
Emission factor: 0.5 tons CO2e per ton waste (includes methane)
Emissions = 100 tons × 0.5 = 50 tons CO2e

Category 6: BUSINESS TRAVEL
Transportation of employees for business activities (in vehicles not owned/controlled).

Includes:
- Air travel (short-haul, long-haul)
- Rental cars
- Taxis and ride-shares
- Hotels

Example - Air Travel:
50 employees, 2 round-trip flights/year, 2,000 miles each
Total miles: 50 × 2 × 2,000 = 200,000 miles
Emission factor: 0.18 kg CO2e per passenger-mile (economy, medium-haul)
Emissions = 200,000 miles × 0.18 kg/mile = 36,000 kg = 36 tons CO2e

Category 7: EMPLOYEE COMMUTING
Transportation of employees between homes and worksites.

Calculation methods:
- Average-data: Number of employees × Average commute distance × Days worked × Emission factor
- Surveying employees

Example - Employee Commuting:
100 employees, 20 miles round-trip average, 230 days/year, 25 MPG, single occupancy
Total miles: 100 × 20 × 230 = 460,000 miles
Fuel: 460,000 / 25 = 18,400 gallons
Emissions = 18,400 gallons × 8.89 kg CO2/gallon = 163,576 kg = 163.6 tons CO2

Category 8: UPSTREAM LEASED ASSETS
Operation of assets leased by reporting company (not included in Scope 1 or 2).

DOWNSTREAM EMISSIONS (Categories 9-15):

Category 9: DOWNSTREAM TRANSPORTATION AND DISTRIBUTION
Transportation and distribution of products sold (in vehicles not owned/controlled).

Category 10: PROCESSING OF SOLD PRODUCTS
Processing of intermediate products by third parties after sale.

Category 11: USE OF SOLD PRODUCTS
End use of goods and services sold.

Example - Electronics Manufacturer:
Laptops sold: 10,000 units
Average electricity use: 50 kWh/year over 5-year life
Grid emission factor: 0.417 tons CO2/MWh
Emissions = 10,000 units × 50 kWh/year × 5 years × 0.417 tons/1,000 kWh = 1,042.5 tons CO2e

Category 12: END-OF-LIFE TREATMENT OF SOLD PRODUCTS
Waste disposal and treatment of products sold at end of life.

Category 13: DOWNSTREAM LEASED ASSETS
Operation of assets owned by reporting company and leased to other entities (not in Scope 1 or 2).

Category 14: FRANCHISES
Operation of franchises (not in Scope 1 or 2).

Category 15: INVESTMENTS
Operation of investments (equity investments, debt investments, project finance, managed investments).

4.3 SCOPE 3 SCREENING AND PRIORITIZATION

Not all 15 categories are relevant to every company. Recommended approach:

Step 1: SCREENING
Evaluate all 15 categories for relevance and significance.

Step 2: PRIORITIZATION
Focus on categories that:
- Represent >5% of total Scope 3 emissions
- Offer emissions reduction opportunities
- Are deemed critical by stakeholders
- Contribute to company's climate-related risks/opportunities

Step 3: DATA COLLECTION
Start with available data and improve over time:
- Year 1: Spend-based estimates
- Year 2: Hybrid approach (spend + activity data)
- Year 3+: Supplier-specific data where material

=============================================================================
5. SCOPE COMPARISON AND BOUNDARIES
=============================================================================

KEY DISTINCTIONS:

Scope 1 vs Scope 2:
- Scope 1: Direct combustion in owned/controlled equipment
- Scope 2: Indirect from purchased energy generated elsewhere

Scope 1 vs Scope 3 (Category 4):
- Scope 1: Fuel burned in company-owned vehicles
- Scope 3 Cat 4: Third-party logistics providers

Scope 2 vs Scope 3 (Category 3):
- Scope 2: Emissions from electricity generation
- Scope 3 Cat 3: Upstream extraction/transport of fuels + T&D losses

AVOIDING DOUBLE COUNTING:

Between Scopes:
- Ensure clear boundary definitions
- If activity is in Scope 1, exclude from Scope 2 or 3

Across Companies:
- Scope 1 for seller = Scope 3 for buyer
- Total emissions across value chain should sum correctly
