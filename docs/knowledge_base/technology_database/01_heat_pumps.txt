INDUSTRIAL HEAT PUMPS: TECHNOLOGY, ECONOMICS, AND APPLICATIONS
=============================================================================

1. TECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW

1.1 DEFINITION
Industrial heat pumps transfer thermal energy from a low-temperature source to a higher-temperature sink using mechanical or thermal compression, enabling waste heat recovery and process heating with high efficiency.

Key Principle: Move 3-5 units of heat using only 1 unit of electrical energy input, achieving 300-500% efficiency compared to direct heating's ~95% efficiency.

1.2 THERMODYNAMIC CYCLE

Vapor Compression Cycle (most common):
1. Evaporator: Refrigerant absorbs heat from low-temp source, evaporates
2. Compressor: Increases pressure and temperature of vapor
3. Condenser: Refrigerant releases heat to high-temp sink, condenses
4. Expansion valve: Reduces pressure, returning to low temp
5. Cycle repeats

Heat Delivered = Compressor Work + Heat Absorbed from Source

1.3 COEFFICIENT OF PERFORMANCE (COP)

COP = Useful Heat Output / Electrical Energy Input

Typical COP Ranges:
- Low-temp applications (35-50°C): COP 3.5-5.0
- Medium-temp applications (50-90°C): COP 2.5-4.0
- High-temp applications (90-160°C): COP 1.8-3.0

Example:
Heat pump with COP 4.0
Input: 100 kW electrical
Output: 400 kW thermal
Heat from source: 300 kW (400 - 100)

Carnot Efficiency Limitation:
COP_carnot = T_hot / (T_hot - T_cold)

Where temperatures in Kelvin.

Example Carnot COP:
T_cold = 15°C = 288K (heat source)
T_hot = 55°C = 328K (heat sink)
COP_carnot = 328 / (328-288) = 328/40 = 8.2

Real COP typically 40-60% of Carnot COP:
COP_real ≈ 8.2 × 0.5 = 4.1

=============================================================================
2. INDUSTRIAL HEAT PUMP TYPES
=============================================================================

2.1 COMPRESSION HEAT PUMPS

A) ELECTRIC VAPOR COMPRESSION

=============================================================================
3. HEAT SOURCES AND APPLICATIONS
=============================================================================

3.1 HEAT SOURCES (LOW-TEMPERATURE SIDE)

A) WASTE HEAT SOURCES
- Cooling water from industrial processes: 20-40°C
- Wastewater: 15-30°C
- Refrigeration system condensers: 25-40°C
- Exhaust air from buildings/processes: 20-35°C
- Process off-gas: 30-80°C

B) AMBIENT SOURCES

- Groundwater: 8-12°C (stable year-round)
- Surface water (rivers, lakes): 4-20°C
- Ground source (geothermal): 10-15°C at 2m depth

Best Practice: Higher source temperature = Higher COP
Example:
- Air source at 0°C: COP 2.5
- Water source at 15°C: COP 4.0
- Waste heat at 35°C: COP 5.0

3.2 HEAT APPLICATIONS (HIGH-TEMPERATURE SIDE)

=============================================================================
4. SIZING AND PERFORMANCE
=============================================================================

4.1 HEAT PUMP SIZING

Key Parameters:
1. Heat demand (kW)
2. Source temperature and availability
3. Sink (delivery) temperature
4. Operating hours per year
5. Load profile (constant vs. variable)

Sizing Approaches:

BASE LOAD SIZING:
Size heat pump for continuous base load, use backup heating for peaks.

Example:
Peak heat demand: 1,000 kW
Base load: 600 kW (60% of time)
Heat pump: 600 kW capacity
Backup boiler: 400 kW (for peaks)

Result: Heat pump runs 8,000 hours/year at high capacity factor

FULL LOAD SIZING:
Size for peak demand, accept lower capacity factor.

4.2 PART-LOAD PERFORMANCE

Heat pumps experience efficiency degradation at part load:

Variable Speed Drive (VSD):
- Maintains ~95% COP at 50% load
- Better than on/off cycling

Fixed Speed:
- COP drops 10-20% at 50% load with cycling

Best Practice: Use VSD for variable loads

4.3 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE

Seasonal Performance Factor (SPF):
SPF = Total Annual Heat Delivered / Total Annual Electricity Consumed

SPF accounts for:
- Varying source temperatures
- Part-load operation
- Defrost cycles (air source)
- Auxiliary equipment (pumps, fans)

SPF typically 10-20% lower than rated COP:
- Rated COP 4.0 → SPF 3.2-3.6

=============================================================================
5. ECONOMICS AND SAVINGS
=============================================================================

5.1 CAPITAL COSTS

Typical Installed Costs (2024, $/kW thermal capacity):

Small Systems (<200 kW):
- Air source: $600-900/kW
- Water source: $700-1,000/kW
- Ground source: $1,200-1,800/kW (includes ground loop)

Medium Systems (200-1,000 kW):
- Air source: $450-700/kW
- Water source: $500-800/kW

Large Industrial (>1,000 kW):
- Water/waste heat source: $350-600/kW
- High-temp (>100°C): $700-1,200/kW

Cost Components:
- Equipment: 50-60%
- Installation: 20-30%
- Controls and integration: 10-15%
- Engineering: 5-10%

5.2 OPERATING COSTS

Annual Operating Cost = Electricity Cost - Avoided Fuel Cost

Example Calculation:
Heat pump: 500 kW thermal, COP 3.5, 5,000 hours/year
Electricity rate: $0.10/kWh
Natural gas displaced: $8.00/MMBtu
Boiler efficiency: 85%

Heat pump electricity:
- Power input: 500 kW / 3.5 = 143 kW
- Annual consumption: 143 kW × 5,000 hr = 715,000 kWh
- Cost: 715,000 × $0.10 = $71,500/year

Natural gas displaced:
- Heat delivered: 500 kW × 5,000 hr = 2,500 MWh = 8,530 MMBtu
- Gas for boiler: 8,530 / 0.85 = 10,035 MMBtu
- Cost avoided: 10,035 × $8 = $80,280/year

Net Annual Savings: $80,280 - $71,500 = $8,780/year

5.3 PAYBACK PERIOD

Simple Payback = Capital Cost / Annual Savings

Using example above:
Capital cost: 500 kW × $700/kW = $350,000
Annual savings: $8,780
Simple payback: $350,000 / $8,780 = 39.9 years ❌ NOT VIABLE

Improving Economics:
If waste heat source available at 40°C instead of air:
- COP improves: 3.5 → 4.5
- Electricity: 500 kW / 4.5 = 111 kW
- Annual cost: 111 × 5,000 × $0.10 = $55,500
- Savings: $80,280 - $55,500 = $24,780/year
- Payback: $350,000 / $24,780 = 14.1 years ✓ VIABLE

Key Finding: Waste heat source critical for economics

Payback: $245,000 / $24,780 = 9.9 years ✓ ATTRACTIVE

=============================================================================
6. EMISSIONS REDUCTION
=============================================================================

6.1 CARBON SAVINGS CALCULATION

Emissions Avoided = Gas Boiler Emissions - Heat Pump Emissions

Example:
Heat delivered: 2,500 MWh/year
Natural gas displaced: 10,035 MMBtu (from earlier example)
Gas emission factor: 53.06 kg CO2/MMBtu
Grid emission factor: 0.417 tons CO2/MWh

Gas boiler emissions:
10,035 MMBtu × 53.06 kg/MMBtu = 532,457 kg = 532.5 tons CO2/year

Heat pump emissions:
715 MWh elec × 0.417 tons/MWh = 298.2 tons CO2/year

Net reduction: 532.5 - 298.2 = 234.3 tons CO2/year (44% reduction)

6.2 GRID CARBON INTENSITY SENSITIVITY

Break-even Grid Intensity:
Heat pump only reduces emissions if:
Grid Intensity < Gas Intensity / COP

Example:
Gas: 53.06 kg/MMBtu ≈ 0.183 kg CO2/kWh thermal
Heat pump COP: 3.5
Break-even: 0.183 × 3.5 = 0.641 kg CO2/kWh = 641 g CO2/kWh

Heat pumps reduce emissions in grids below 641 g/kWh (most grids worldwide).

US Average (417 g/kWh): ✓ Heat pumps reduce emissions
Coal-heavy grid (800 g/kWh): ❌ Heat pumps may increase emissions (unless COP >4.4)

- Operating hours: 6,500 hours/year

Solution:
Heat pump system:
- Capacity: 800 kW thermal output
- Source: Cooling water (35°C)
- Sink: Process hot water (65°C)
- COP: 4.2 (high due to favorable temperatures)

Economics:
- Capital cost: 800 kW × $550/kW = $440,000
- Electricity input: 800 / 4.2 = 190 kW
- Annual electricity: 190 kW × 6,500 hr = 1,235 MWh
- Electricity cost: 1,235 MWh × $100/MWh = $123,500/year

Natural gas avoided:
- Heat delivered: 800 kW × 6,500 hr = 5,200 MWh = 17,745 MMBtu
- Gas for boiler: 17,745 / 0.85 = 20,876 MMBtu
- Gas cost avoided: 20,876 MMBtu × $8/MMBtu = $167,008/year

Annual savings: $167,008 - $123,500 = $43,508/year

With 30% ITC:
- Net capital: $440,000 × 0.70 = $308,000
- Simple payback: $308,000 / $43,508 = 7.1 years ✓

Emissions Reduction:
- Gas emissions: 20,876 MMBtu × 53.06 kg/MMBtu = 1,108 tons CO2
- Electricity emissions: 1,235 MWh × 0.417 tons/MWh = 515 tons CO2
