- Evacuated tube collectors
- Parabolic trough concentrators
- Applications: Industrial process heat, steam generation, absorption cooling

High Temperature (>250°C):
- Parabolic trough (up to 400°C)
- Linear Fresnel reflectors (up to 400°C)
- Power tower (up to 600°C)
- Applications: High-pressure steam, power generation, chemical processes

2. COLLECTOR TECHNOLOGIES
=============================================================================

2.1 FLAT PLATE COLLECTORS (FPC)

Design:
- Absorber plate (copper or aluminum with selective coating)
- Transparent glazing (glass or polymer)
- Insulation (back and sides)
- Housing (aluminum or steel frame)

Performance:
- Efficiency: 50-70% at low temperatures
- Operating temperature: 30-90°C
- Optical efficiency (η₀): 0.70-0.80
- Heat loss coefficient: 3-5 W/m²K

Typical Dimensions:
- Panel size: 2.0m × 1.0m (2 m² gross area)
- Weight: 35-45 kg
- Aperture area: 1.8-1.9 m² (effective collecting area)

Efficiency Equation:
η = η₀ - a₁(Tm - Ta)/G - a₂(Tm - Ta)²/G

Where:
- η₀ = Optical efficiency
- a₁ = Linear heat loss coefficient
- a₂ = Quadratic heat loss coefficient
- Tm = Mean fluid temperature (°C)
- Ta = Ambient temperature (°C)
- G = Solar irradiance (W/m²)

Example at 800 W/m² irradiance, 60°C fluid, 20°C ambient:
η = 0.75 - 3.5(60-20)/800 - 0.015(60-20)²/800
η = 0.75 - 0.175 - 0.03 = 0.545 (54.5% efficiency)

Advantages:
+ Lower cost ($150-300/m²)
+ Simple installation
+ No tracking required
+ Good for diffuse light
+ Long lifetime (20-25 years)

Disadvantages:
- Limited to <90°C economically
- Heat losses increase at higher temperatures
- Not suitable for high-temperature industrial processes

2.2 EVACUATED TUBE COLLECTORS (ETC)

=============================================================================
3. SOLAR RESOURCE AND SITE SELECTION
=============================================================================

3.1 SOLAR IRRADIANCE TYPES

Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI):
- Total solar radiation on horizontal surface
- Includes direct and diffuse components
- Relevant for flat plate and evacuated tube collectors
- Units: kWh/m²/day or kWh/m²/year

Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI):
- Direct beam radiation perpendicular to sun
- Only direct component (excludes diffuse)
- Relevant for concentrating collectors (PTC, LFR)
- Requires clear skies
- Units: kWh/m²/day or kWh/m²/year

Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI):
- Scattered radiation from sky and clouds
- GHI = DNI × cos(zenith angle) + DHI

Typical Annual Values:
- Sunny desert (Phoenix, AZ): GHI 2,350 kWh/m²/yr, DNI 2,550 kWh/m²/yr
- Moderate climate (New York): GHI 1,400 kWh/m²/yr, DNI 1,100 kWh/m²/yr
- Cloudy climate (Seattle): GHI 1,200 kWh/m²/yr, DNI 800 kWh/m²/yr

Rule of Thumb:
- Flat plate/ETC: Viable with GHI >1,200 kWh/m²/yr
- Concentrating (PTC/LFR): Requires DNI >1,800 kWh/m²/yr

3.2 SITE ASSESSMENT

Key Factors:
✓ Solar resource (GHI or DNI depending on technology)
✓ Available land area (unshaded, south-facing in Northern Hemisphere)
✓ Proximity to heat demand (minimize pipe runs)
✓ Structural capacity (roof-mounted systems)
✓ Grid connection (if hybrid with electric backup)

Shading Analysis:
- Conduct sun path analysis
- Identify shading from buildings, trees, terrain
- Calculate shading loss percentage

Tilt Angle Optimization:
For flat plate/ETC, tilt angle affects annual yield:
- Optimal tilt ≈ Latitude (for year-round performance)
- Summer optimization: Latitude - 15°
- Winter optimization: Latitude + 15°

Example - New York (40°N latitude):
- Horizontal (0°): 1,400 kWh/m²/yr
- 30° tilt: 1,520 kWh/m²/yr (+8.6%)
- 40° tilt: 1,550 kWh/m²/yr (+10.7%) ← Optimal
- 50° tilt: 1,540 kWh/m²/yr (+10%)

3.3 LAND AREA REQUIREMENTS

Flat Plate / Evacuated Tube:
- Roof-mounted: 1.0-1.2× collector area (minimal spacing)
- Ground-mounted: 1.5-2.0× collector area (row spacing to avoid shading)

Concentrating (PTC/LFR):
- Ground area: 2.5-3.5× aperture area (tracking clearance and row spacing)

Example - 1 MW thermal parabolic trough:
- Aperture area: ~3,000 m² (assuming 300 W/m² average thermal)
- Land area: 3,000 × 3 = 9,000 m² ≈ 2.2 acres

=============================================================================
4. SYSTEM DESIGN AND SIZING
=============================================================================

4.1 HEAT DEMAND ANALYSIS

Match solar supply to demand:

Daily Profile:
- Solar availability: Peak at solar noon, zero at night
- Demand profile: May be constant, daytime-only, or variable

Strategies:
1. Direct use (no storage): Size for daytime demand
2. With storage: Size larger, store excess for night/cloudy periods
3. Hybrid: Solar + backup (boiler, heat pump)

Solar Fraction:
SF = Solar Heat Delivered / Total Heat Demand

Target Solar Fractions:
- Without storage: SF 20-40% (economic optimum)
- With storage: SF 40-70%
- With seasonal storage: SF 70-90% (rarely economic)

4.2 COLLECTOR ARRAY SIZING

Basic Sizing Equation:
Collector Area = (Annual Heat Demand × Solar Fraction) / (Solar Resource × System Efficiency × Utilization Factor)

Where:
- Annual heat demand: kWh/year
- Solar fraction: 0-1
- Solar resource: kWh/m²/year (GHI or DNI)
- System efficiency: 0.4-0.6 (includes collector, piping, storage losses)
- Utilization factor: 0.7-0.9 (accounts for mismatch between supply and demand)

Example:
Facility: Textile dyeing plant
- Annual heat demand: 2,000 MWh/year (120°C process water)
- Target solar fraction: 30%
- Location: Southern California, GHI 2,100 kWh/m²/yr
- Technology: Evacuated tube collectors
- System efficiency: 45% (at 120°C)
- Utilization: 80% (daytime operation matches solar)

Calculation:
Collector area = (2,000,000 kWh × 0.30) / (2,100 kWh/m² × 0.45 × 0.80)
Collector area = 600,000 / 756 = 794 m²

Use: 800 m² evacuated tube collectors (400 collectors × 2 m² each)

4.3 THERMAL STORAGE SIZING

Storage enables use of solar heat during non-solar hours.

Storage Capacity:
Q_storage = m × Cp × ΔT

Where:
- Q = Storage capacity (kWh)
- m = Mass of storage medium (kg)
- Cp = Specific heat capacity (kJ/kg·K)
- ΔT = Temperature difference (K)

Water Storage:
Cp = 4.18 kJ/kg·K = 1.16 Wh/kg·K

Example:
Store 500 kWh thermal in water, ΔT = 40°C (70°C to 110°C)
Mass = 500 kWh / (1.16 Wh/kg·K × 40 K) = 10,776 kg ≈ 11 m³ water

Tank sizing rule: 50-100 liters per m² of collector area

Types of Storage:
- Sensible heat (water tanks): Most common, $50-150/kWh
- Phase change materials (PCM): Higher density, $200-500/kWh
- Thermochemical: Emerging, high density, expensive

=============================================================================

5.1 CAPITAL COSTS (2024 USD)

Example Project Cost - 1,000 m² ETC system with storage:
- Collectors: 1,000 m² × $350/m² = $350,000
- Storage: 100 kWh × $100/kWh = $10,000
- Balance of system: 1,000 m² × $150/m² = $150,000
- Installation: 1,000 m² × $75/m² = $75,000
- Total: $585,000

5.2 ENERGY PRODUCTION AND SAVINGS

Annual Energy Production:
E_annual = Collector Area × Solar Resource × System Efficiency × Utilization

Using earlier example (800 m² ETC, Southern California):
E_annual = 800 m² × 2,100 kWh/m²/yr × 0.45 × 0.80 = 604,800 kWh/year

Energy Value (displacing natural gas):
- Natural gas displaced: 604,800 kWh / 0.85 (boiler eff) = 711,529 kWh = 2,429 MMBtu
- Gas cost: $8/MMBtu
- Annual savings: 2,429 MMBtu × $8 = $19,432/year

Capital cost: 800 m² × $500/m² = $400,000
Simple payback: $400,000 / $19,432 = 20.6 years (marginal without incentives)

5.3 LEVELIZED COST OF HEAT (LCOH)

LCOH = (Capital Cost × CRF + Annual O&M) / Annual Energy Production

Where CRF (Capital Recovery Factor) = i(1+i)^n / ((1+i)^n - 1)
- i = discount rate
- n = system lifetime

Example:
Capital: $400,000
Annual O&M: $8,000 (2% of capital)
System life: 20 years
Discount rate: 6%
Annual production: 604,800 kWh

CRF = 0.06(1.06)^20 / ((1.06)^20 - 1) = 0.0872

LCOH = ($400,000 × 0.0872 + $8,000) / 604,800 kWh
LCOH = ($34,880 + $8,000) / 604,800 = $0.071 per kWh = $20.8 per MMBtu

Compare to natural gas: $8/MMBtu → Solar is 2.6× more expensive (without incentives)

5.4 INCENTIVES

- Investment Tax Credit (ITC): 30% for commercial solar thermal
- Bonus credits: +10% if in energy community, +10% if domestic content

Example with ITC:
Capital: $400,000
ITC (30%): $120,000
Net capital: $280,000
Simple payback: $280,000 / $19,432 = 14.4 years ✓ More attractive
