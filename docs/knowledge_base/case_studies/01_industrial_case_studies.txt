- Average electrical input: 185 kW
- Measured COP: 4.05 (close to design 4.1)

Energy Savings:
Heat delivered by heat pump:
- 750 kW × 6,200 hr = 4,650 MWh thermal

Natural gas displaced (accounting for boiler efficiency 82%):
- 4,650 MWh / 0.82 / 0.293 MMBtu/kWh = 19,350 MMBtu/year (35% reduction!)

Additional electricity for heat pump:
- 185 kW × 6,200 hr = 1,147 MWh

Cost Savings:
- Natural gas saved: 19,350 MMBtu × $7/MMBtu = $135,450/year
- Electricity added: 1,147 MWh × $0.10/kWh = -$114,700/year
- Net annual savings: $20,750/year

Wait - this doesn't match the $95k estimated! Let's recalculate with actual gas price increase:

By 2021, natural gas averaged $8.50/MMBtu (higher than audit assumed):
- Gas savings: 19,350 × $8.50 = $164,475
- Electricity cost: -$114,700
- Net savings: $49,775/year (closer, but still below estimate)

Note: Savings lower than projected due to higher-than-expected electricity costs and slightly lower operating hours.

Simple Payback (actual):
- Net capital (after grant): $545,000
- Annual savings: $49,775
- Payback: 10.9 years

Emissions Reduction:
- Gas emissions avoided: 19,350 MMBtu × 53.06 kg/MMBtu = 1,027 tons CO2
- Electricity emissions added: 1,147 MWh × 0.520 tons/MWh = 596 tons CO2

3.3 WASTE HEAT ASSESSMENT

Conducted by: US DOE Industrial Assessment Center + Third-party engineering firm

Waste Heat Sources Identified:

1. Reheat Furnace Flue Gas (PRIMARY OPPORTUNITY):
   - Temperature: 1,100°C (2,012°F) at furnace exit

- Steam turbine for power generation
- Process steam for other facility uses

3.4 TECHNOLOGY SOLUTION

System Design: Combined Waste Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) + Steam Turbine

HRSG Specifications:
- Heat source: Reheat furnace flue gas (1,100°C)
- Configuration: Triple-pressure HRSG (LP, IP, HP steam)
- Steam production:
  * High-pressure: 60 bar, 480°C, 35 tons/hr
  * Intermediate-pressure: 15 bar, 250°C, 20 tons/hr
  * Low-pressure: 4 bar, 150°C, 10 tons/hr
- Stack exit temperature: 180°C (after heat recovery)
- Heat recovery efficiency: 75% of available sensible heat

Steam Turbine:
- Type: Condensing-extraction turbine
- HP steam inlet: 35 tons/hr at 60 bar
- Electrical output: 6.5 MW

- Generator: Synchronous, grid-connected

Heat Recovery Calculation:
Available heat: Flue gas 450,000 kg/hr × 1.05 kJ/kg·K × (1,100°C - 180°C) = 435,000 kJ/s = 435 MW

Wait, that's way higher than 110 MW estimated. Let me recalculate:
Sensible heat: m × Cp × ΔT
450,000 kg/hr = 125 kg/s
Cp ≈ 1.15 kJ/kg·K (average for flue gas)
ΔT = 1,100 - 180 = 920 K
Heat = 125 × 1.15 × 920 = 132,250 kW ≈ 132 MW ✓ (closer to estimate)

HRSG captures 75%: 132 MW × 0.75 = 99 MW useful heat recovered

Steam Energy:
65 tons/hr total steam × 2.5 MJ/kg (average latent + sensible) = 162,500 MJ/hr = 45 MW equivalent

Power Generation:
HP steam through turbine: 35 tons/hr
Turbine efficiency: ~25% (condensing)
Power: 35 tons/hr × 2.8 MJ/kg × 0.25 / 3.6 = 6.8 MW ≈ 6.5 MW ✓

Benefits:
1. Electricity generation: 6.5 MW × 8,400 hr = 54,600 MWh/year
2. Process steam: 30 tons/hr × 8,400 hr = 252,000 tons/year (IP + LP)

3.7 LESSONS LEARNED

Critical Success Factors:
✓ Enormous waste heat resource (reheat furnaces extremely inefficient baseline)
✓ Continuous operation (8,400 hours/year utilization)
✓ High-temperature heat source enables power generation (not just process heat)
✓ Both electricity and steam have immediate use on-site
✓ Management commitment (large capital, complex engineering)
✓ State grant reduced risk

Challenges Encountered:
✗ Complex installation during active production (phased approach required)
✗ Flue gas dust required additional filtration (added $280k to cost)

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: THREE CASE STUDIES
=============================================================================

SUMMARY TABLE:

| Metric | Heat Pump | Solar Thermal | Waste Heat Recovery |
|--------|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Sector | Food Processing | Chemical Mfg | Steel Mill |
| Capital Cost | $665k | $1,765k | $27,950k |
| Annual Savings | $50k | $47k | $4,404k |
| Payback (years) | 10.9 | 27.7 | 4.8 |
| CO2 Reduction | 431 tons/yr | 462 tons/yr | 48,925 tons/yr |
| % of Facility | 5.9% | 6.0% | 9.5% |
| IRR | ~8% | 4.2% | 17.8% |

KEY INSIGHTS:

1. Scale Matters:
   - Large industrial facilities (steel mill) achieve best economics due to scale
   - Small projects (<$1M) face proportionally higher soft costs

2. Temperature Match:
   - Heat pump: Low-temp (best for waste heat source + moderate sink temp)
   - Solar: Medium-temp (evacuated tubes viable to 150°C, PTC to 400°C)
   - Waste heat recovery: Any temp (match recovery to source temperature)

3. Incentives Critical:
   - Heat pump: Grant reduced payback 13.3 → 10.9 years
   - Solar: ITC reduced payback 40+ → 27.7 years (still marginal)
   - WHR: Grant reduced payback 6.3 → 4.8 years

4. Operating Hours Essential:
   - All three projects benefit from >6,000 hours/year operation
   - Batch processes with low utilization struggle economically

5. Non-Financial Drivers Important:
   - Sustainability goals, customer requirements, brand value
   - Steel mill: Award recognition worth $$$ in customer retention
   - Chemical plant: Carbon footprint differentiation

LESSONS ACROSS ALL CASES:

1. Energy Audit First: Professional assessment identifies best opportunities
2. Match Technology to Application: Temperature, load profile, availability
3. Secure Incentives: Grants, tax credits dramatically improve economics
4. Plan for Complexity: Brownfield integration harder than new construction
5. Monitor Performance: Continuous tracking ensures design performance
6. Non-Financial Value: Sustainability, resilience, reputation matter
