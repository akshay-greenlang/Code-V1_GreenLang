## NOTES

This roadmap transforms GreenLang from a functional prototype into a production-grade, enterprise-ready platform. Each phase builds on the previous, ensuring a solid foundation before adding advanced features.

**Key Principles:**
1. **Quality over speed** - Do it right the first time
2. **Test everything** - If it's not tested, it's broken
3. **Document as you go** - Future you will thank present you
4. **Measure everything** - You can't improve what you don't measure
5. **Security first** - Build it in, don't bolt it on

**Remember:** The goal is 10/10, not 10/10 features. Depth beats breadth.
