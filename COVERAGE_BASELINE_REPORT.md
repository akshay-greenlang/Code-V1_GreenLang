4. `greenlang\cli\main_old.py` (328 statements) - Legacy CLI code
5. `greenlang\cli\telemetry.py` (334 statements) - Telemetry tracking
6. `greenlang\cli\main_new.py` (68 statements) - New CLI code
7. `greenlang\cli\assistant.py` (291 statements) - AI assistant features
8. `greenlang\cli\assistant_rag.py` (291 statements) - RAG integration
9. `greenlang\monitoring\health.py` (360 statements) - Health checks
10. `greenlang\monitoring\metrics.py` (274 statements) - Metrics collection
11. `greenlang\telemetry\metrics.py` (286 statements) - Telemetry metrics
12. `greenlang\telemetry\monitoring.py` (261 statements) - Monitoring
13. `greenlang\provenance\tracker.py` (309 statements) - Provenance tracking

## Test Execution Health

### Status: Healthy (with minor issues)

**Successes:**
- ✓ 410 tests collected successfully
- ✓ All imports resolved (ProviderInfo issue fixed)
- ✓ AsyncIO warnings eliminated
- ✓ Coverage data generated successfully
- ✓ HTML reports created in `.coverage_html/`

**Issues:**
- ⚠ Pytest capture plugin has I/O errors on Windows (non-blocking)
- ⚠ Exit code 1 due to coverage being below 85% target (expected)
- ℹ Used workaround: `python -m coverage run` instead of `pytest --cov`

**Performance:**
- Test execution: ~60 seconds for full suite
- Coverage analysis: ~5 seconds
- HTML report generation: ~2 seconds
- **Total time:** ~70 seconds (acceptable)

   - Consider using `-p no:capture` or updating pytest config
   - Investigate Windows-specific capture bug
   - May require pytest version downgrade

2. **Expand AI Agent Tests**
   - Use existing `test_carbon_agent_ai.py` as template
   - Create tests for fuel, intensity, validator agents
   - Target: 80%+ coverage for all agents

3. **Add CLI Command Tests**
   - Start with `doctor` command (most critical)
   - Use Click's testing utilities
   - Mock external dependencies

4. **Intelligence Provider Tests**
   - Mock OpenAI/Anthropic API calls
   - Test error handling and retries
   - Validate response parsing

### Long-term Strategy

1. **Establish Coverage Gates**
   - Require 80% coverage for new code
   - Use pre-commit hooks to enforce
   - Add coverage badges to README

2. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Set up continuous coverage monitoring
   - Create coverage reports in CI/CD
   - Track coverage trends over time

3. **Documentation**
   - Document testing patterns
   - Create test writing guidelines
   - Share best practices (use anomaly_agent as example)

4. **Test Categorization**
   - Unit tests: Fast, isolated
   - Integration tests: External systems
   - E2E tests: Full workflows
   - Mark appropriately with pytest markers
