### 3. Test Infrastructure Fix (In Progress)

**Problem:** 57,252 lines of tests written, only 9.43% executing due to missing torch dependency

**Solution:**
- ‚úÖ torch installed (CPU version)
- üîÑ transformers, sentence-transformers installing
- üîÑ pytest-cov installing

**Expected Impact:** Coverage jumps 9.43% ‚Üí 25-30%

## WEEK 1 EXECUTION PLAN (Oct 14-18, 2025)

### Day 1 (Monday): Infrastructure & Testing
- ‚úÖ Complete dependency installation
- Run full pytest coverage baseline
- Fix remaining import errors
- Document coverage improvements

### Day 2 (Tuesday): AgentSpec Templates
- Create base AgentSpec YAML template
- Define tool-first architecture pattern
- Create validation schemas
- Set up AgentSpec validator

### Day 3 (Wednesday): First Agent Spec
- Generate Agent #1: IndustrialProcessHeatAgent_AI spec
- Create complete YAML with 7 tools
- Write validation tests
- Peer review and refinement

### Day 4 (Thursday): Spec Generation System
- Build AgentSpec generator from GL_Agents_84.md
- Extract tool definitions automatically
- Create batch generation pipeline
- Generate specs for Agents #2-5

### Day 5 (Friday): Week 1 Validation

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### Week 1 Goals (MUST ACHIEVE):
1. ‚úÖ Test coverage ‚â•25% (up from 9.43%)
2. ‚úÖ All test suites import successfully
3. ‚úÖ 5 agent specs created and validated
4. ‚úÖ AgentSpec generation pipeline operational
5. ‚úÖ CI/CD updated with torch dependency

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Test Coverage Blocker:** RESOLVED - Dependencies installing
