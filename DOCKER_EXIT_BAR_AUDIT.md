# Docker Multi-Arch Build Exit Bar Audit Report

**Status: NO_GO**
**Readiness Score: 55/100**
**Release Version: 0.2.0**
**Date: 2025-09-20**

## Executive Summary

The Docker multi-arch build infrastructure is **well-designed but not yet executed**. Critical blockers prevent production readiness:
1. No images published to registries (GHCR or Docker Hub)
2. Only amd64 architecture built locally (arm64 not built)
3. No cosign signatures or SBOM attached
4. Image sizes exceed budgets significantly

**Estimated Time to Production: 2-4 hours**

## Definition of Done Compliance

| # | Requirement | Status | Notes |
|---|-------------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Published to GHCR and Docker Hub | ❌ NOT STARTED | Workflow ready but not triggered |
| 2 | Multi-arch manifest (amd64/arm64) | ❌ NOT TESTED | Only amd64 built locally |
| 3 | Signed with cosign (keyless OIDC) | ⚠️ CONFIGURED | Requires push to execute |
| 4 | SBOM generated and attached | ⚠️ CONFIGURED | Requires push to execute |
| 5 | Vulnerability scan passes | ⚠️ CONFIGURED | Requires push to execute |
| 6 | Non-root user and healthcheck | ✅ COMPLETE | UID 10001, healthcheck defined |
| 7 | gl --version command works | ✅ COMPLETE | Returns version correctly |
| 8 | Size budgets (≤300MB/≤1GB) | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Runner: 367MB (exceeds 300MB) |
| 9 | Example pipeline executes | ❓ NOT TESTED | Requires running container |
| 10 | OCI labels present | ✅ COMPLETE | All standard labels configured |

## Critical Blockers

### 1. Registry Publication Not Started
- **Problem**: Images not pushed to any registry
- **Impact**: Cannot be used in production, no signing or SBOM
- **Fix**: Trigger GitHub Actions workflow
- **Required Actions**:
  1. Create and push tag: `git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release v0.2.0"`
  2. Push tag: `git push origin v0.2.0`
  3. Or use GitHub UI workflow dispatch with version 0.2.0

### 2. Multi-Architecture Not Validated
- **Problem**: Only amd64 built locally, arm64 not built
- **Impact**: No ARM support for M1/M2 Macs or ARM servers
- **Fix**: Trigger GitHub Actions workflow (has QEMU configured for multi-arch)

### 3. Image Sizes Exceed Budgets
- **Problem**: Runner 367MB (exceeds 300MB), Full 13.7GB (exceeds 1GB)
- **Impact**: Slower pulls, higher storage costs, performance issues
- **Fix**: Optimize Dockerfiles after initial release

## Infrastructure Assessment

### ✅ Excellent Components
- **Dockerfiles**: Security hardened, non-root, read-only rootfs
- **GitHub Workflow**: Comprehensive with all features configured
- **Security**: Proper UID (10001), dropped capabilities, minimal attack surface
- **Build Optimization**: Multi-stage builds, cache mounts, efficient layering

### ⚠️ Needs Attention
- **Image Size**: Runner at 367MB exceeds 300MB budget, Full at 13.7GB exceeds 1GB budget
- **Registry Access**: Images not accessible from GHCR or Docker Hub
- **Security Attestation**: No signatures or SBOMs attached

## Current State vs Required State

### What's Working
- ✅ Dockerfile.runner with all security features
- ✅ Dockerfile.full for dev/CI use
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow fully configured
- ✅ Non-root user (UID 10001)
- ✅ Healthcheck implemented
- ✅ OCI labels with metadata
- ✅ `gl version` subcommand works
- ✅ `gl --version` flag works
- ✅ Local amd64 build successful

### What's Not Working
- ❌ Multi-arch builds not executed
- ❌ Images not in registries
- ❌ Signing not performed
- ❌ SBOM not generated
- ❌ Vulnerability scan not run
- ❌ arm64 not tested
- ❌ Image sizes exceed budgets

## Action Plan for Go-Live

### Immediate Actions (30 minutes)
1. **Configure Docker Hub Secrets (if using Docker Hub)**
   - Go to GitHub repo settings
   - Add secret: `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`
   - Add secret: `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`
   - Note: GHCR uses GITHUB_TOKEN automatically

### Build & Release Actions (2-3 hours)
2. **Trigger Multi-Arch Build**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Create and push tag
   git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release v0.2.0"
   git push origin v0.2.0

   # Option 2: Use GitHub UI
   # Go to Actions → release-docker.yml → Run workflow
   # Enter version: 0.2.0
   ```

3. **Monitor Workflow**
   - Watch GitHub Actions progress
   - Verify both architectures build
   - Check GHCR and Docker Hub for images
   - Review vulnerability scan results

### Post-Release Validation (30 minutes)
4. **Verify Production Readiness**
   ```bash
   # Test published images
   docker run --rm ghcr.io/akshay-greenlang/greenlang-runner:0.2.0 --version
   docker run --rm --platform linux/arm64 ghcr.io/akshay-greenlang/greenlang-runner:0.2.0 --version

   # Verify signatures
   cosign verify ghcr.io/akshay-greenlang/greenlang-runner:0.2.0 \
     --certificate-identity-regexp "https://github.com/.*" \
     --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com

   # Check SBOM
   cosign download sbom ghcr.io/akshay-greenlang/greenlang-runner:0.2.0
   ```

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level: HIGH**

- **Technical Risk**: Images not built for multi-architecture
- **Operational Risk**: No images in production registries
- **Security Risk**: Security features configured but not validated
- **Compliance Risk**: DoD requirements not met

## Recommendations

### Must Fix Before Release
1. Build and push multi-arch images via GitHub Actions
2. Ensure cosign signatures are applied
3. Generate and attach SBOMs
4. Validate all security features

### Should Fix Soon
1. Reduce runner image size to ≤300MB
2. Build and test full image
3. Run example pipeline in container

### Nice to Have
1. Add image size optimization (distroless base)
2. Implement SLSA Level 3 attestation
3. Add container structure tests

## Conclusion

The Docker multi-arch build task has **excellent infrastructure** but requires **execution to complete DoD requirements**. The primary blocker is that the GitHub Actions workflow has not been triggered. Once executed, the comprehensive workflow will handle all remaining requirements automatically including multi-arch builds, signing, SBOM generation, and vulnerability scanning.

**Final Verdict**: NO_GO - Trigger GitHub Actions workflow to build, sign, scan, and publish multi-arch images for full DoD compliance.
