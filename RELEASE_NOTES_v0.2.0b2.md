# v0.2.0b2 ‚Äì Infra Seed (Beta 2)

üåç **GreenLang v0.2.0b2** brings the foundational infrastructure for climate-intelligent development with enhanced stability and core framework improvements.

## üì¶ Installation

### From TestPyPI (Beta Channel)

```bash
# Install from TestPyPI
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ greenlang==0.2.0b2

# Verify installation
gl --version
```

### From GitHub Releases

```bash
# Download wheel directly
curl -L https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/greenlang/releases/download/v0.2.0b2/greenlang-0.2.0b2-py3-none-any.whl -o greenlang-0.2.0b2-py3-none-any.whl
pip install greenlang-0.2.0b2-py3-none-any.whl
```

## üöÄ 10-Minute Quickstart

### 1. Initialize Your First Climate-Aware Project

```bash
# Create a new project
mkdir my-green-project
cd my-green-project

# Initialize GreenLang workspace
gl init --project-type=basic
```

### 2. Create Your First Policy

```bash
# Generate a sample energy-efficiency policy
gl policy create --template=energy-efficiency --name=my-first-policy

# View the generated policy
gl policy list
```

### 3. Run Basic Climate Intelligence

```bash
# Execute a simple carbon assessment
gl run --mode=assessment --target=./

# View carbon impact metrics
gl metrics show --type=carbon
```

### 4. Explore Core Components

```bash
# List available agents
gl agents list

# Check system health
gl health check

# View framework capabilities
gl info --verbose
```

### 5. Run Example Workflows

```bash
# Execute a sample green computing workflow
gl workflow run --template=renewable-scheduling

# Monitor real-time carbon impact
gl monitor start --metrics=carbon,energy
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Dependencies
- **pandas/numpy currently required**: These will become optional dependencies in v0.2.1. Currently needed for the solar resource agent's data processing capabilities.
- **Large dependency footprint**: Working on modularizing dependencies for lighter installs.

### Warnings
- **Pydantic deprecation warnings**: Some third-party dependencies trigger Pydantic v1 compatibility warnings. These are harmless and will be resolved as dependencies update.
- **asyncio event loop warnings**: May appear on Windows systems when using certain LLM integrations.

### Platform Compatibility
- **Windows path handling**: Some file path operations may require absolute paths on Windows systems.
- **macOS M1/M2**: All features supported, some NumPy operations may show performance warnings.

### Features in Development
- **Hub connectivity**: Pack discovery and sharing features are experimental.
- **Advanced LLM integrations**: OpenAI/Anthropic integrations are functional but may have rate limiting issues.
- **Real-time carbon monitoring**: Requires external carbon intensity APIs that may have availability limitations.
