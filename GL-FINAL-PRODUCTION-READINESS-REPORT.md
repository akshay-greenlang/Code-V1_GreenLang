#### **Dimension 4: Deterministic AI Guarantees**

**Score: 90/100** | **Status: PARTIAL** | **Weight: 10%** | **Weighted: 9.0**

**Evidence:**
- CalculatorAgent: 100% deterministic (zero-hallucination) ✅
- IntakeAgent: 100% deterministic (no LLM) ✅
- AggregatorAgent: 100% deterministic (no LLM) ✅
- AuditAgent: 100% deterministic (no LLM) ✅
- MaterialityAgent: AI-powered (GPT-4/Claude) with required human review ⚠️
- ReportingAgent: Hybrid (XBRL deterministic + narratives use AI with review) ⚠️
- Reproducibility not yet proven in tests (10-run verification missing) ⚠️

**CalculatorAgent (100% Deterministic):**
```python
class CalculatorAgent:
    """Zero hallucination guarantee."""

    def calculate(self, metric_code, inputs):
        # Database lookup only
        formula = self.formulas_db[metric_code]
        # Python arithmetic only
        result = eval(formula.expression, inputs)
        return result
```

**MaterialityAgent (AI-Powered, Review Required):**
```python
class MaterialityAgent:
    """AI-powered double materiality assessment.

    AI Model: GPT-4 / Claude 3.5 Sonnet
    Human Review: REQUIRED
    """

    async def assess_materiality(self, context):
        # LLM call with temperature=0.0, seed=42
        response = await self.llm.chat(
            messages=context,
            temperature=0.3,  # NOT 0.0 - needs creativity
            seed=null,        # NOT deterministic
            tools=self.tools
        )
        # Return with review_required flag
        return {
            "result": response,
            "review_required": True,  # MANDATORY
            "confidence": response.confidence
        }
```

**Configuration Verification:**
```yaml
# MaterialityAgent:
guarantees:
  zero_hallucination: false
  deterministic: false
  requires_human_review: true  # CRITICAL

# CalculatorAgent:
guarantees:
  zero_hallucination: true
  deterministic: true
  reproducible: true
  calculation_accuracy: 100%
```

**Gaps:**
