- Comprehensive test suite with 54 tests covering:
  - Unit tests for thermodynamic calculations
  - Integration tests for AI orchestration
  - Determinism tests
  - Boundary tests
  - Async execution tests
- Missing coverage primarily in error handling paths and edge cases
- **Estimated Current Score:** 85-90/100
- **Gap to 95:** ~5-10 points (likely D7 deployment, D11 monitoring)

**Next Steps:**
- Add deployment manifests (D7: +10 points)

### ðŸ”´ 5. CarbonAgentAI - COVERAGE DATA MISSING

**Status:** TESTS RUNNING BUT COVERAGE NOT CALCULATED

```
Tests: 13 passed, 1 failed
Coverage: NO DATA (test stopped early)
Test Failure: test_execute_with_mocked_ai - async support issue
```

**Issue:** pytest stopped before generating coverage due to async test failure.

**Recommended Fixes:**
1. Install pytest-asyncio: `pip install pytest-asyncio`
2. Add `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorators to async tests
3. Re-run coverage analysis

**Estimated Effort:** 1 day to fix + analyze

---

### ðŸ”´ 6. GridFactorAgentAI - COVERAGE DATA MISSING

**Status:** TESTS RUNNING BUT COVERAGE NOT CALCULATED

```
Tests: 13 passed, 1 failed
Coverage: NO DATA (test stopped early)
Test Failure: test_generate_recommendations_clean_grid - Assertion error
```

**Issue:** Test assertion failure: Expected â‰¥2 recommendations but got 1 for clean hydro-heavy grid (Brazil).

**Recommended Fixes:**
1. Fix test assertion or update `_generate_recommendations_impl()` logic
2. Re-run coverage analysis

**Estimated Effort:** 1 day to fix + analyze

---

### ðŸ”´ 7. RecommendationAgentAI - COVERAGE DATA MISSING

**Status:** TESTS RUNNING BUT COVERAGE NOT CALCULATED

```
Tests: 22 passed, 1 failed
Coverage: NO DATA (test stopped early)
Test Failure: test_execute_with_mocked_ai - async support issue
```

**Issue:** pytest stopped before generating coverage due to async test failure.

**Recommended Fixes:**
1. Install pytest-asyncio
2. Add async test decorators
3. Re-run coverage analysis

**Estimated Effort:** 1 day to fix + analyze

---

### ðŸ”´ 8. FuelAgentAI - COVERAGE DATA MISSING

**Status:** TESTS RUNNING BUT COVERAGE NOT CALCULATED

```
Tests: 6 passed, 1 failed
Coverage: NO DATA (test stopped early)
Test Failure: test_run_with_mocked_ai - async support issue
```

**Issue:** Only 6 tests exist (very low). Async test failure prevents coverage calculation.

**Recommended Fixes:**
1. Install pytest-asyncio
2. Expand test suite significantly (target: 25-30 tests minimum)
3. Re-run coverage analysis

**Estimated Effort:** 5-7 days (needs major test suite expansion)

---

## Primary Blockers Identified

### ðŸ”´ BLOCKER #1: Async Test Support
**Impact:** Prevents coverage calculation for 4 agents (CarbonAgentAI, RecommendationAgentAI, FuelAgentAI, ReportAgentAI)

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install pytest-asyncio
```

Add to conftest.py or pytest.ini:
```python
[tool:pytest]
asyncio_mode = auto
```

**Estimated Fix Time:** 30 minutes

---

### ðŸ”´ BLOCKER #2: Low Test Count
**Impact:** FuelAgentAI has only 6 tests (needs 25-30)

**Solution:** Build comprehensive test suite following IndustrialProcessHeatAgentAI template (54 tests, 85.97% coverage)

**Test Categories Needed:**
- Unit tests: 15+ (one per tool/method)
- Integration tests: 5+
- Determinism tests: 3+
- Boundary tests: 5+
- Error handling tests: 5+

**Estimated Effort:** 5-7 days for FuelAgentAI alone

---

### ðŸŸ¡ BLOCKER #3: Minor Test Failures
**Impact:** 3 agents have 1 failing test each (ReportAgentAI, GridFactorAgentAI)

**Solutions:**
1. **ReportAgentAI:** Update assertion or fix formatting logic
2. **GridFactorAgentAI:** Fix recommendation generation for clean grids

**Estimated Fix Time:** 2-4 hours each

---

## Conclusion

**Primary Finding:** Test coverage (D3) is the main blocker preventing agents from reaching 95/100 production readiness.

**Good News:**
- 1 agent (IndustrialProcessHeatAgentAI) already meets the 80% requirement
- 2 agents (BoilerReplacementAgentAI, IndustrialHeatPumpAgentAI) are within 3% of threshold
- 1 agent (ReportAgentAI) had syntax issues which are now FIXED

**Path Forward:** With focused effort on test suite expansion and fixing async test support, all 8 agents can reach 95/100 production readiness within 7-12 weeks.

**Immediate Next Step:** Install pytest-asyncio and re-run coverage analysis on the 4 agents with missing data to get complete baseline.
