   - See instructions below

---

## 🔍 **HOW TO CHECK CI RESULTS**

### **Method 1: GitHub Web UI** (Recommended)

1. **Open your repository in browser:**
   ```
   https://github.com/akshay-greenlang/Code-V1_GreenLang
   ```

2. **Click on "Actions" tab** at the top

3. **Look for the latest workflow run:**
   - Should see: "feat(tests): Complete Phase 1 Week 1-2..."
   - Commit: `b00ef65`
   - Status will be one of:
     - 🟡 **Yellow/Orange** = Running (wait)
     - ✅ **Green checkmark** = Passed (SUCCESS!)
     - ❌ **Red X** = Failed (needs fixing)

4. **Click on the workflow run** to see details

5. **Check each job:**
   - `tests` - Should show all tests passing
   - `security` - Should pass security scans

### **Method 2: Using Git (Command Line)**

Wait 10-20 minutes, then:

```bash
# Check latest commit status
git log --oneline -1
# Should show: b00ef65 feat(tests): Complete Phase 1 Week 1-2...

# Fetch latest from remote
git fetch origin

# If you have GitHub CLI installed:
gh run list --limit 5

# Or check commit status:
git log --oneline --graph -5
```

### **Method 3: Email Notifications**

If you have GitHub notifications enabled:
- Check your email for GitHub Actions notifications
- You'll receive an email when the workflow completes
- Email will indicate success or failure

---

## 📊 **WHAT CI IS CHECKING**

Based on `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/test.yml`:

### **CI Workflow (ci.yml):**
- ✅ Tests on Ubuntu, macOS, Windows
- ✅ Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- ✅ Coverage measurement with pytest-cov
- ✅ Coverage threshold: **85% minimum**
- ✅ JUnit XML report generation
- ✅ Security scans

### **Test Workflow (test.yml):**
- ✅ Linting (ruff)
- ✅ Type checking (mypy --strict)
- ✅ Code formatting (black)
- ✅ Coverage ≥85% overall
- ✅ Coverage ≥90% for agents
- ✅ Tests complete in <90 seconds

---

## ✅ **EXPECTED RESULTS**

If everything passes, you should see:

```
✅ CI Gate Check - All checks passed
   ✅ Tests (ubuntu-latest, py3.10) - PASSED
   ✅ Tests (ubuntu-latest, py3.11) - PASSED
   ✅ Tests (ubuntu-latest, py3.12) - PASSED
   ✅ Tests (macos-latest, py3.10) - PASSED
   ✅ Tests (macos-latest, py3.11) - PASSED
   ✅ Tests (macos-latest, py3.12) - PASSED
   ✅ Tests (windows-latest, py3.10) - PASSED
   ✅ Tests (windows-latest, py3.11) - PASSED
   ✅ Tests (windows-latest, py3.12) - PASSED
   ✅ Security Scan - PASSED
   ✅ Coverage: 85%+ overall
   ✅ Coverage: 90%+ for agents
```

---

## ❌ **IF CI FAILS**

If any tests fail:

### **Step 1: Check the Failure**

1. Click on the failed job in GitHub Actions
2. Scroll to the red X
3. Read the error message

### **Step 2: Common Failures & Fixes**

#### **Import Errors:**
```python
ImportError: cannot import name 'X' from 'greenlang.Y'
```

**Fix:** Check if module exists, fix import path

#### **Coverage Below Threshold:**
```
ERROR: Coverage 78% is below 85% threshold
```

**Fix:** Add more tests to uncovered lines

#### **Test Failures:**
```
AssertionError: assert X == Y
```

**Fix:** Check test logic, verify expected values

### **Step 3: Fix and Re-Push**

```bash
# Make fixes locally
# Then commit and push again:
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Resolve CI test failures"
git push

# CI will run again automatically
```

## 📈 **VIEWING COVERAGE REPORTS**

Once CI passes:

### **Option 1: Download Artifacts from GitHub**

1. Go to the successful workflow run
2. Scroll to bottom: "Artifacts"
3. Download `coverage-ubuntu-latest-py3.11`
4. Extract and open `coverage.xml`

### **Option 2: Upload to CodeCov** (Future)

Configure CodeCov integration:
```yaml
- name: Upload coverage to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    file: ./coverage.xml
```

### **Option 3: Generate Locally** (Future)

Once Python is installed:
```bash
pip install pytest pytest-cov
pytest tests/agents/ --cov=greenlang.agents --cov-report=html
start .coverage_html/index.html
```

## 🚨 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **"Workflow not found"**

- Wait 1-2 minutes after pushing
- Refresh the GitHub Actions page
- Check that push was successful: `git log --oneline -1`

### **"CI is taking too long"**

- Normal duration: 10-20 minutes
- Maximum duration: 30 minutes
- If > 30 minutes, check for hanging tests

### **"How do I see which tests failed?"**

1. Click on the failed job
2. Expand the "Run unit tests with coverage" step
3. Scroll through output to find failures
4. Look for `FAILED tests/agents/test_X.py::test_Y`

If CI fails and you need assistance:

1. **Check the error message** in GitHub Actions
2. **Copy the full error log**
3. **Share with your team** or create an issue
