Edge Case Test Suite for GL-004 BURNMASTER

This package contains comprehensive edge case tests covering:
- Extreme operating conditions (temperature, pressure, fuel compositions)
- Sensor failures (individual, multiple, cascading)
- Communication failures (timeouts, packet loss, protocol errors)
- Concurrent operations (race conditions, deadlocks)
- Boundary conditions (firing rates, fuel switchover, hydrogen blends)
- Failure recovery (flame loss, emergency shutdown, cascading failures)
- Determinism under stress (high-frequency updates, memory pressure)
- Property-based tests with Hypothesis
