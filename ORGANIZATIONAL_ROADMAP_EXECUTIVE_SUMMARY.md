## KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR LEADERSHIP

### What Success Requires

1. **Hire Exceptional Leaders Early**
   - VP Engineering (Q1 2026) is the #1 priority hire
   - Cannot scale engineering without world-class VP Eng

2. **Move Fast, But Deliberately**
   - 6-8x current velocity is extraordinary, but unsustainable
   - Hire VP Eng to create sustainable pace

3. **Culture Is Not Optional**
   - 3 → 1000 people will destroy culture without deliberate investment
   - Measure culture quarterly, hire VP People by 2028

4. **Capital Efficiency Matters**
   - Target: 75th percentile comp, not 90th
   - Every $1M saved = 2-3 months additional runway

5. **Stay Mission-Driven**
   - Climate impact is the North Star
   - Best talent joins mission-driven companies

### What Failure Looks Like

- **Hiring Too Slow:** Competitors out-execute, customers churn due to understaffing
- **Hiring Too Fast:** Burn cash without revenue growth, culture collapse
- **Wrong Leaders:** Bad VP Eng or VP Sales hire sets company back 12-18 months
- **Ignoring Culture:** Attrition spikes, best people leave, death spiral begins
