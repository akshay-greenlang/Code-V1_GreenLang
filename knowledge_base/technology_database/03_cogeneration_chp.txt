COMBINED HEAT AND POWER: TECHNOLOGY, EFFICIENCY, AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
=============================================================================

1. TECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW

1.1 DEFINITION
Combined Heat and Power (CHP), also called cogeneration, is the simultaneous production of electricity and useful thermal energy from a single fuel source. By capturing and utilizing waste heat from power generation, CHP systems achieve 70-90% total efficiency compared to 45-55% for separate heat and power.

Key Concept:
TRADITIONAL SYSTEM:
- Power plant: 100 units fuel → 35 units electricity + 65 units waste heat (35% efficient)
- Boiler: 100 units fuel → 85 units useful heat (85% efficient)
- Total: 200 units fuel → 35 units electricity + 85 units heat (60% overall efficiency)

CHP SYSTEM:
- CHP: 100 units fuel → 30 units electricity + 55 units useful heat (85% total efficiency)
- Result: Same outputs, 50% less fuel consumption

1.2 BASIC CONFIGURATIONS

Topping Cycle (Most Common):
Fuel → Prime Mover → Electricity → Waste Heat Recovery → Thermal Energy

Bottoming Cycle (Less Common):
Fuel → Process Heat → Waste Heat → Power Generation → Electricity

=============================================================================
3. HEAT RECOVERY EQUIPMENT
=============================================================================

3.1 HEAT RECOVERY STEAM GENERATOR (HRSG)

Function: Recovers heat from exhaust gas to produce steam.

Configurations:
- Single-pressure: Produces one steam pressure level
- Dual-pressure: Low-pressure and high-pressure steam
- Triple-pressure: LP, IP, HP steam (for combined cycle power plants)

Performance:
- Approach temperature: 10-20°C (difference between exhaust exit and steam temp)
- Stack temperature: 90-150°C (after heat recovery)
- Heat recovery efficiency: 70-85% of exhaust energy

Steam Production:
Q_steam = m_exhaust × Cp × (T_in - T_out) × η_HRSG

Example:
Engine exhaust: 5,000 kg/hr at 500°C
Stack temp: 120°C
HRSG efficiency: 80%
Heat recovered: 5,000 kg/hr × 1.05 kJ/kg·K × (500-120)K × 0.80 = 1,596 kW

Steam (150 psig saturated): h_fg = 1,950 kJ/kg
Steam production: 1,596 kW / 1,950 kJ/kg = 0.82 kg/s = 2,952 kg/hr = 6,510 lb/hr

=============================================================================
4. SYSTEM SIZING AND DESIGN
=============================================================================

4.1 THERMAL-TO-ELECTRIC RATIO MATCHING

Critical Design Principle:
Size CHP to match facility's thermal-to-electric ratio, OR plan to export/import power/heat.

Facility Ratios:
Heat-Heavy (Thermal : Electric > 2:1):
- Hospitals
- Universities
- Food processing
- Pulp & paper
→ Best match: Engines, gas turbines (high heat ratio)

Balanced (Thermal : Electric 1:1 to 2:1):
- Manufacturing
- Commercial buildings
→ Match: Engines with moderate heat recovery

Electric-Heavy (Thermal : Electric < 1:1):
- Data centers (cooling loads)
- Commercial offices
→ May require absorption chiller to utilize heat

Example Analysis:
Facility annual consumption:
- Electricity: 10,000 MWh
- Thermal: 15,000 MWh (natural gas boiler)
- Ratio: 15,000 / 10,000 = 1.5 : 1

1 MW Reciprocating Engine:
- Electricity: 1 MW
- Heat recovery: 1.35 MW
- Ratio: 1.35 : 1 ✓ GOOD MATCH

If CHP sized at 1 MW:
- Annual CHP electricity: 1 MW × 8,000 hr = 8,000 MWh (80% of demand)
- Annual CHP heat: 1.35 MW × 8,000 hr = 10,800 MWh (72% of demand)
- Grid electricity import: 2,000 MWh
- Boiler heat: 4,200 MWh

4.2 OPERATING STRATEGIES

Base-Load Operation (Most Common):
- CHP runs continuously at full load
- Sized for minimum continuous thermal or electric load
- Simple controls, maximum efficiency, best economics

Typical sizing: 50-80% of minimum load

Load-Following:
- CHP output varies to match electrical or thermal demand
- Requires more sophisticated controls
- Part-load efficiency penalties

Stand-By (Emergency) Power:
- CHP sized for critical loads
- Runs only during grid outages
- Poor economics (low utilization)

4.3 ELECTRICAL INTERCONNECTION

Grid-Parallel (Most Common):
- CHP connected to utility grid
- Can import/export power
- Requires utility interconnection agreement

Islanded (Off-Grid):
- CHP operates independently
- Must match load precisely
- Requires black-start capability

Interconnection Costs:
- Small systems (<1 MW): $50,000-200,000
- Large systems (>5 MW): $200,000-1,000,000+

Net metering vs. standby charges (varies by utility and jurisdiction)

- Electrical gear: $150,000
- Installation: $200,000
- Engineering: $100,000
- Total: $1,400,000 ($1,400/kWe)

5.2 OPERATING COSTS

Fuel Costs:
Largest operating expense, typically 70-85% of total operating cost.

Fuel consumption:
Fuel (MMBtu/hr) = Electricity Output (kW) / Electrical Efficiency / 293

Example 1 MW engine, 40% efficiency:
Fuel = 1,000 kW / 0.40 / 293 = 8.53 MMBtu/hr (HHV)

Annual fuel (8,000 hours):
8.53 MMBtu/hr × 8,000 hr = 68,240 MMBtu/year

Fuel cost @ $8/MMBtu:
68,240 × $8 = $545,920/year

Maintenance:
- Reciprocating engines: $0.015-0.025/kWh
- Gas turbines: $0.008-0.015/kWh
- Microturbines: $0.010-0.020/kWh

1 MW engine maintenance:
8,000 MWh/year × $0.020/kWh = $160,000/year

Total Annual Operating Cost:
- Fuel: $545,920
- Maintenance: $160,000
- Insurance, property tax: $20,000
- Total: $725,920/year

5.3 ENERGY SAVINGS

CHP Value = Electricity Savings + Thermal Savings - Fuel Cost - O&M Cost

Electricity Savings:
- Grid electricity avoided
- 1 MW × 8,000 hr = 8,000 MWh
- @ $0.12/kWh = $960,000/year

Thermal Savings:
- Heat recovery: 1.35 MW × 8,000 hr = 10,800 MWh thermal
- Displaces gas boiler (85% efficiency)
- Gas avoided: 10,800 MWh / 0.85 / 0.293 = 43,400 MMBtu
- @ $8/MMBtu = $347,200/year

Total Savings:
$960,000 + $347,200 = $1,307,200/year

Net Savings:
$1,307,200 - $725,920 (fuel + O&M) = $581,280/year

Simple Payback:
$1,400,000 / $581,280 = 2.4 years ✓ EXCELLENT

5.4 SPARK SPREAD ANALYSIS

Spark Spread: The difference between electricity price and gas price (adjusted for efficiency).

Spark Spread ($/MWh) = Electricity Price ($/MWh) - [Gas Price ($/MMBtu) × Heat Rate (MMBtu/MWh)]

Heat Rate = 3.412 MMBtu/MWh / Electrical Efficiency

Example:
Electricity: $120/MWh
Natural gas: $8/MMBtu
Engine efficiency: 40%
Heat rate: 3.412 / 0.40 = 8.53 MMBtu/MWh

Spark spread = $120 - ($8 × 8.53) = $120 - $68.24 = $51.76/MWh

Rule of Thumb:
- Spark spread >$30/MWh: CHP likely economical
- Spark spread $20-30/MWh: Marginal
- Spark spread <$20/MWh: CHP difficult to justify

5.5 INCENTIVES

United States (IRA 2022):
- Investment Tax Credit (ITC): 30% for CHP >1 MW (if meets efficiency standards)
- Efficiency requirement: >60% total efficiency, >20% electric efficiency
- Bonus credits available for energy communities and domestic content

Example with ITC:
Capital: $1,400,000
ITC (30%): $420,000
Net capital: $980,000
Payback: $980,000 / $581,280 = 1.7 years ✓ VERY ATTRACTIVE

State/Utility Incentives:
- Varies widely by jurisdiction
- California SGIP (Self-Generation Incentive Program): $0.50-1.00/W
- New York: Accelerated depreciation
- Massachusetts: DOER grants
