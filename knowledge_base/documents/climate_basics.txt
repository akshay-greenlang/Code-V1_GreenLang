                Carbon Emissions and Climate Change
                
                Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the primary greenhouse gas emitted through human activities.
                In 2019, CO2 accounted for about 80% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from 
                human activities. The main human activity that emits CO2 is the combustion of 
                fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and oil) for energy and transportation.
                
                Key emission factors:
                - Electricity: 0.4-0.7 kg CO2/kWh (varies by grid)
                - Natural Gas: 0.185 kg CO2/kWh
                - Coal: 0.34 kg CO2/kWh
                - Gasoline: 2.31 kg CO2/liter
