## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Business Case

The EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) mandates 50,000+ companies globally to report detailed sustainability data according to European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). This creates a massive market opportunity:

- **Market Size:** $15B (software + consulting)
- **Addressable Companies:** 50,000+ (2025-2028 rollout)
- **First Reports Due:** Q1 2025 (largest companies)
- **Penalties:** Up to 5% of annual revenue for non-compliance

Current solutions are inadequate:
- Manual reporting: Error-prone, time-consuming (200+ hours per report)
- Generic ESG software: Lacks ESRS-specific features, no XBRL tagging
- Consultancies: Expensive ($50K-$200K per report), not scalable

### 1.2 Solution

Build a comprehensive, AI-powered CSRD reporting platform with:
- **Zero-hallucination calculations** (100% deterministic)
- **1,000+ ESRS data points** automated
- **XBRL digital tagging** for regulatory submission
- **AI-powered materiality assessment**
- **Complete audit trail** for external assurance
- **<30 min processing** time

### 1.3 Strategic Alignment

This project aligns with GreenLang's mission to provide **zero-hallucination AI for climate intelligence**. The platform demonstrates GreenLang's core capabilities:
1. Deterministic calculations for regulatory compliance
2. AI-augmented human decision-making (materiality assessment)
3. Complete provenance tracking
4. Multi-agent orchestration

Success here opens doors to:
- ISSB (International Sustainability Standards Board) reporting
- SEC climate disclosure (US)
- TCFD, GRI, SASB automation
- Supply chain ESG verification
