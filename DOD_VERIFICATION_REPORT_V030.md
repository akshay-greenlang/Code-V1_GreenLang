# Definition of Done (DoD) Verification Report
## GreenLang v0.3.0 Release

**Date**: 2025-09-26
**Version**: 0.3.0
**Release Branch**: release/0.3.0
**Status**: **NO_GO** ‚õî

## Executive Summary

The GreenLang v0.3.0 release has been evaluated against the CTO's Definition of Done requirements. While significant progress has been made in implementing security features and documentation, **critical gaps in production readiness prevent a GO decision**.

### Key Findings:
- ‚úÖ Security architecture is properly implemented (default-deny, sandboxing)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Signature verification still relies on stub implementations in some paths
- ‚úÖ Documentation and examples are comprehensive
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Weekly metrics collection exists but no actual metrics have been generated
- ‚úÖ RC release workflow is comprehensive and includes signing

---

## SECURITY GATE CHECKS

### 1. Default-deny Policy ‚úÖ **PASS**

**Evidence Found:**
- ‚úÖ OPA tests with deny-by-default exist in `tests/unit/security/test_default_deny_policy.py`
- ‚úÖ Capabilities default to False in manifest.py:
  - `net.allow: bool = Field(default=False)`
  - `fs.allow: bool = Field(default=False)`
  - `subprocess.allow: bool = Field(default=False)`
- ‚úÖ Runtime enforcement verified in Docker backend (`network=none` when not allowed)
- ‚úÖ K8s backend creates NetworkPolicy to deny all traffic by default

**Test Coverage:**
- `test_no_policy_loaded_denies()`
- `test_unsigned_pack_denied_by_default()`
- `test_runtime_deny_without_authentication()`

### 2. Signed-only Enforcement ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL PASS**

**Evidence Found:**
- ‚úÖ Signature verification is mandatory by default in `installer.py`
- ‚úÖ `install_pack()` rejects unsigned unless `allow_unsigned=True` explicitly set
- ‚úÖ Cosign/sigstore integration code exists
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ISSUE**: Stub verification fallback exists when cosign/sigstore unavailable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ISSUE**: Production mode check relies on environment variable `GREENLANG_DEV_MODE`

**Code Concerns:**
```python
# Line 157-164 in signatures.py
# Only allow stub in dev mode
logger.warning("DEV MODE: Using stub verification (NOT SECURE)")
verification_result = self._verify_signature_stub(...)
```

**Recommendation**: Remove stub verification entirely or make it compile-time conditional.

### 3. Sandbox Capabilities Isolation ‚úÖ **PASS**

**Evidence Found:**
- ‚úÖ Docker runner implements network isolation:
  - Uses `network_mode = "none"` when network not allowed
  - Filesystem paths restricted via volume mounts
- ‚úÖ K8s SecurityContext implementation:
  - `_create_security_context()` sets proper container restrictions
  - NetworkPolicy created to deny all ingress/egress
  - Pod security context enforces non-root user
- ‚úÖ Capability validation in installer prevents dangerous binaries/paths

**Security Controls:**
- Network: Isolated by default, allowlist-based egress
- Filesystem: Read/write path restrictions enforced
- Subprocess: Binary allowlist validation

## CRITICAL ISSUES BLOCKING RELEASE

### 1. Security Stub Fallback üî¥ **BLOCKER**
- **Issue**: Production code contains development stubs for signature verification
- **Risk**: Could allow unsigned code execution if environment misconfigured
- **Fix Required**: Remove stub verification or make compile-time only

### 2. Missing Metrics Data ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**
- **Issue**: No actual weekly metrics have been generated
- **Risk**: Cannot validate performance baselines
- **Fix Required**: Run metrics collection to establish baseline

### 3. Environment-based Security üî¥ **BLOCKER**
- **Issue**: Security enforcement depends on `GREENLANG_DEV_MODE` environment variable
- **Risk**: Production deployment could accidentally enable dev mode
- **Fix Required**: Build-time separation of dev/prod code

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### Must Fix Before Release:
1. **Remove signature verification stubs** from production code paths
2. **Eliminate environment-based security switches** - use build-time configuration
3. **Run weekly metrics collection** to establish baseline
4. **Add production configuration validation** to prevent dev mode in production

### Should Complete:
1. Generate and publish first weekly metrics report
2. Add integration tests for signature verification
3. Document production deployment requirements
4. Create security checklist for operators

---

## FINAL VERDICT: NO_GO ‚õî

**Rationale**: While GreenLang v0.3.0 has made excellent progress on security architecture and documentation, the presence of development stubs in security-critical paths represents an unacceptable risk for production deployment. The signature verification fallback to stub mode based on environment variables could be exploited if misconfigured.

**Required for GO Decision**:
1. Complete removal of stub verification code from production builds
2. Build-time separation of development and production code paths
3. Successful generation of at least one weekly metrics report
4. Security review confirming no bypass mechanisms

**Estimated Time to GO**: 2-3 days of focused development to address blockers.
