## üí° CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **Security First**: Fix all blockers before features
2. **Incremental Delivery**: Ship working code weekly
3. **Community Engagement**: Build in public
4. **Quality Over Quantity**: Better 10 great packs than 15 mediocre
5. **Documentation**: Every feature documented
6. **Testing**: Maintain >90% coverage
7. **Performance**: Monitor and optimize continuously

---

## üé¨ FINAL NOTES

This roadmap reflects the reality discovered by engineering sub-agents analyzing 97K+ lines of code. The codebase is more mature than expected (70% complete) but has critical security gaps that must be addressed first.

**Remember**: We're building the "LangChain for Climate Intelligence" - orchestration and composition over calculation ownership.

**Success Formula**:
```
Security First + Realistic Targets + Right Resources + Community Focus =
75% Success Probability
```
