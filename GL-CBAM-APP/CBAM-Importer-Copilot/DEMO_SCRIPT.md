## 📖 DEMO SCRIPT

### PART 1: The Problem (2 minutes)

**Slide 1: EU CBAM Regulation**

*"The EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) went into effect October 2023. Every EU importer must now file quarterly reports on embedded emissions for 5 product categories: Cement, Steel, Aluminum, Fertilizers, and Hydrogen."*

**The Pain Points:**
1. **Manual Data Entry** - 10,000 shipments = 40 hours of data entry
2. **Complex Calculations** - Default emission factors vs supplier actuals
3. **Error-Prone** - One wrong number = €1.5M penalty (€150/ton × 10K tons)
4. **Audit Trail** - Regulators demand complete provenance
5. **20% Rule** - Complex goods over 20% trigger extra scrutiny

**Slide 2: Current Solutions**

*"Existing solutions are either:"*
- **Manual Excel templates** - Error-prone, no validation, 5+ days per filing
- **Generic AI chatbots** - Hallucinate numbers, not compliant, no audit trail
- **Enterprise ERP modules** - 6-month implementation, $500K+

**The Market Need:**
*"Companies need a solution that's accurate, fast, and compliant. That's exactly what we built."*

### PART 3: Live Demo (4 minutes)

**Demo Setup:**
- Fresh terminal window
- Demo data: `examples/demo_shipments.csv` (5 sample records)
- Show directory structure first

#### Step 1: Installation (30 seconds)

```bash
# Show how easy it is to get started
pip install greenlang-cli
gl pack install cbam-importer-demo

# That's it! <30 seconds to production-ready system
```

#### Step 2: Quick Configuration (30 seconds)

```bash
# Generate config file
gl cbam config init --output my_config.yaml

# Show the config file (highlight simplicity)
cat my_config.yaml

# Key fields:
# - Importer info (name, EORI, country)
# - Data sources (CN codes, emission factors)
# - Optional: supplier actuals
```

#### Step 3: Generate CBAM Report (1 minute)

```bash
# Single command generates complete filing pack
gl cbam report \
  --input examples/demo_shipments.csv \
  --config my_config.yaml \
  --output cbam_report.json \
  --provenance

# Show real-time progress:
# ✓ Reading shipments... (5 records)
# ✓ Validating CBAM rules... (0 errors)
# ✓ Calculating emissions... (5 shipments)
# ✓ Generating report... (1 file)
# ✓ Creating provenance... (SHA256, audit trail)
#
# Done in 0.8 seconds!
```

#### Step 4: Inspect Output (1 minute)

```bash
# Show the report structure
jq '.report_metadata' cbam_report.json

# Output:
{
  "title": "EU CBAM Quarterly Report",
  "reporting_period": "2025-Q3",
  "importer": "Demo Company NL",
  "generated_at": "2025-10-15T14:23:45Z"
}

# Show emissions summary
jq '.emissions_summary' cbam_report.json

# Output:
{
  "total_embedded_emissions_tco2": 192.85,
  "total_shipments": 5,
  "total_quantity_tons": 75.5,
  "average_emission_factor": 2.55
}

# Show provenance (CRITICAL for compliance!)
jq '.provenance.input_file_integrity' cbam_report.json

# Output:
{
  "sha256_hash": "a3f5c8d2e9b1...",  # Cryptographic proof!
  "file_name": "demo_shipments.csv",
  "file_size_bytes": 1024
}
```

#### Step 5: Validate Reproducibility (30 seconds)

```bash
# Run the same command twice
gl cbam report --input examples/demo_shipments.csv --config my_config.yaml --output report1.json
gl cbam report --input examples/demo_shipments.csv --config my_config.yaml --output report2.json

# Compare emissions (MUST be identical)
diff <(jq '.emissions_summary.total_embedded_emissions_tco2' report1.json) \
     <(jq '.emissions_summary.total_embedded_emissions_tco2' report2.json)

# Result: NO DIFFERENCE
# This proves ZERO HALLUCINATION - 100% deterministic!
```

#### Step 6: SDK Demo (30 seconds)

```python
# Show Python SDK (for ERP integration)
from cbam_sdk import cbam_build_report, CBAMConfig

# Load config
config = CBAMConfig.from_yaml('my_config.yaml')

# Generate report (5 lines of code!)
report = cbam_build_report(
    input_file='examples/demo_shipments.csv',
    config=config,
    save_output=True
)

# Access results
print(f"Total Emissions: {report.total_emissions_tco2} tCO2")
print(f"Shipments Processed: {report.total_shipments}")

# Convert to DataFrame for analysis
df = report.to_dataframe()
```

### PART 4: Technical Deep-Dive (2 minutes)

**Slide 4: Zero Hallucination Architecture**

*"The most critical feature of our system is the ZERO HALLUCINATION GUARANTEE. Let me explain how we achieve this..."*

**The Problem with LLMs:**
```python
# ❌ DANGEROUS: LLM generates emission factor
prompt = "What's the emission factor for steel from China?"
response = llm.generate(prompt)
emission_factor = float(response)  # HALLUCINATED!

# If hallucinated: 2.5 instead of 2.0
# Error on 10K tons: 5,000 tCO2
# Penalty: €750,000 (€150/ton)
```

**Our Solution: Tool-First Architecture**
```python
# ✅ SAFE: Database lookup + Python arithmetic
emission_factor = database.lookup(
    product="steel",
    country="CN",
    production_method="blast_furnace_bof"
)
# Returns: 2.0 tCO2/ton (from IEA World Steel 2023)

embedded_emissions = quantity_tons * emission_factor
# Python arithmetic: 100% deterministic
# Example: 10.5 * 2.0 = 21.0 tCO2 (exact, reproducible)
```

**Mathematical Proof:**
- Run calculation 10 times → 10 identical results
- Bit-perfect reproducibility
- Complete audit trail (SHA256 hashes, agent logs)
- Regulators can verify: no LLM in calculation path

**Slide 5: Test Coverage**

*"We don't just claim zero hallucination - we prove it with tests:"*

```python
# Test: Bit-perfect reproducibility
def test_bit_perfect_reproducibility():
    results = []
    for i in range(10):
        result = calculate_emissions(shipments)
        results.append(result.total_emissions)

    # ALL 10 results must be EXACTLY identical
    assert len(set(results)) == 1  # ✅ PASSES
```

**140+ Tests:**
- Unit tests for each agent
- Integration tests for complete pipeline
- Performance benchmarks
- Security scans
- Provenance validation

## 🎬 DEMO BEST PRACTICES

### Pre-Demo Checklist
- [ ] Test demo environment (clean install)
- [ ] Verify demo data loads correctly
- [ ] Practice timing (stay under 10 minutes)
- [ ] Prepare backup slides (if live demo fails)
- [ ] Test internet connection (for Hub install)

### During Demo
- ✅ **Start with the pain point** - Hook audience with €1.5M penalty story
- ✅ **Show, don't tell** - Live terminal, not slides
- ✅ **Highlight zero hallucination** - Run reproducibility test
- ✅ **Emphasize speed** - 10,000 shipments in 30 seconds
- ✅ **End with provenance** - SHA256 hashes = compliance proof

### Handling Questions

**Q: "How do you prevent hallucinations?"**
*A: "We don't use LLMs for calculations. All emission factors come from authoritative databases (IEA, IPCC), and calculations use Python arithmetic. Every number is 100% deterministic and reproducible."*

**Q: "What if EU changes the rules?"**
*A: "Our rules engine (cbam_rules.yaml) is configuration-driven. Updates take minutes, not months."*

**Q: "How do you handle complex goods?"**
*A: "We implement the 20% rule exactly as specified in EU regulation. Agent 3 automatically flags reports where complex goods exceed 20%."*

**Q: "What about real supplier emissions data?"**
*A: "Our system supports both default emission factors and supplier-specific actuals. Simply add a suppliers.yaml file with verified data."*

**Q: "Can this integrate with our ERP?"**
*A: "Yes! Our Python SDK has 5 lines of code integration. We support file-based (CSV, Excel, JSON) and programmatic (pandas DataFrame) workflows."*
