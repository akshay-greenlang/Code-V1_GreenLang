```bash
$ git diff --stat HEAD tests/agents/
 tests/agents/test_anomaly_agent_iforest.py   | 580 ++++++++++++
 tests/agents/test_carbon_agent_ai.py         | 678 ++++++++++++
 tests/agents/test_forecast_agent_sarima.py   | 673 ++++++++++++
 tests/agents/test_fuel_agent_ai.py           | 619 ++++++++++++
 tests/agents/test_grid_factor_agent_ai.py    | 628 ++++++++++++
 tests/agents/test_recommendation_agent_ai.py | 506 ++++++++++++
 tests/agents/test_report_agent_ai.py         | 501 ++++++++++++
 7 files changed, 4185 insertions(+)
```

**Finding:** All +4,185 lines of test code exist but are **NOT COMMITTED** to git.

### Evidence 2: No Python Installation on Local Machine

```bash
$ python --version
Python was not found; run without arguments to install from the Microsoft Store...

$ py --version
/usr/bin/bash: line 1: py: command not found

$ pytest --version
/usr/bin/bash: line 1: pytest: command not found
```

**Finding:** Python and pytest are **NOT INSTALLED** on the development machine.

### Evidence 3: No Test Execution Artifacts

```bash
$ ls -la .pytest_cache .coverage* coverage.xml htmlcov
ls: cannot access '.pytest_cache': No such file or directory
ls: cannot access 'coverage.xml': No such file or directory
ls: cannot access 'htmlcov': No such file or directory
-rw-r--r-- 1 aksha 197609 834 Oct 14 10:42 .coveragerc
```

**Finding:** No test execution artifacts exist. Tests have **NEVER BEEN RUN** locally.

### Evidence 4: No Python Bytecode

```bash
$ find . -name "*.pyc" -o -name "__pycache__"
(no output - no Python bytecode found)
```

**Finding:** No Python bytecode exists, confirming tests have **NEVER BEEN EXECUTED**.

### Evidence 5: CI/CD Configuration Exists But Hasn't Run on New Tests

**CI/CD Files Found:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Requires 85% coverage
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Requires 85% overall, 90% for agents

**Latest Git Commits (test-related):**
```bash
$ git log --oneline --all --grep="test" -i --since="2 weeks ago"

## WHAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE (The Gaps)

### Critical Gaps (Must Do):

#### 1. **Install Python & Dependencies** (15 minutes)
```bash
# Install Python 3.11 from python.org
# Then:
pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-asyncio pytest-mock
pip install -e .[test,dev]
```

#### 2. **Run Tests Locally** (30 minutes)
```bash
# Execute all 7 agent tests
pytest tests/agents/ -v

# Expected: All tests should pass (or identify failures to fix)
```

#### 3. **Measure Actual Coverage** (30 minutes)
```bash
# Generate coverage reports
pytest tests/agents/ \
  --cov=greenlang.agents \
  --cov-report=html:.coverage_html \
  --cov-report=xml:coverage.xml \
  --cov-report=term-missing

# Expected: 80%+ coverage for all agents
```

#### 4. **Fix Any Gaps** (1-2 hours if needed)
- If coverage < 80%, add targeted tests
- If tests fail, fix syntax/import/logic errors
- Re-run until all pass with 80%+ coverage

#### 5. **Commit Changes** (10 minutes)
```bash
git add tests/
git add pytest.ini pyproject.toml tests/conftest.py
git commit -m "feat: Complete Phase 1 Week 1-2 test coverage expansion

- Add comprehensive tests for all 7 AI/ML agents (4,185 lines)
- Expand FuelAgentAI to 85-90% coverage (65+ tests)
- Expand CarbonAgentAI to 85-90% coverage (75+ tests)
- Expand GridFactorAgentAI to 85-90% coverage (80+ tests)
- Expand RecommendationAgentAI to 80%+ coverage (55+ tests)
- Expand ReportAgentAI to 80%+ coverage (65+ tests)
- Expand SARIMAForecastAgent to 80-85% coverage (81+ tests)
- Expand IsolationForestAnomalyAgent to 80-85% coverage (79+ tests)
- Fix AsyncIO event loop issues (pytest-asyncio integration)
- Implement ChatSession mocking in conftest.py
- Configure pytest-cov with 80% threshold
- Create 14 reusable test data fixtures

Closes Phase 1 Week 1-2 deliverables from GL_100_AGENT_MASTER_PLAN.md
"

git push
```

#### 6. **Verify CI/CD Passes** (5-10 minutes)
- Wait for GitHub Actions to run
- Verify all tests pass in CI
- Verify coverage thresholds met (85% overall, 90% for agents)

#### 7. **Deploy Coverage Dashboard** (1-2 hours)
- Set up CodeCov or Coveralls
- Configure automatic uploads from CI
- Add coverage badges to README

**Total Time to 100% Verified Completion:** **4-6 hours**
