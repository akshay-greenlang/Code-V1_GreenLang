# FRMW-202 DoD Quick Checklist - CTO Review

**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Review Type:** Strategic DoD Completeness Assessment
**Verdict:** SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE - Approve with P0 Enhancements

---

## 30-Second Decision

**Question:** Is the DoD complete enough to ship to production?

**Answer:** ✅ **YES, with 5 critical enhancements (2-3 weeks)**

**Risk without enhancements:** 🔴 HIGH (no monitoring, no security review, breaking changes possible)

**Risk with P0 enhancements:** 🟢 LOW (production-grade, enterprise-ready)

---

## Critical Gaps (P0 - MUST FIX before GA)

| # | Gap | Why It Matters | Effort | Owner |
|---|-----|----------------|--------|-------|
| 1 | ❌ No Monitoring/Alerting | Can't detect production errors | 1 week | DevOps |
| 2 | ❌ No Incident Runbook | 4hr MTTR → angry users | 3 days | SRE |
| 3 | ❌ No Backward Compat Tests | CLI upgrades break user workflows | 1 week | QA |
| 4 | ❌ No Security Review | Vulnerability could slip through | 1 week | Security |
| 5 | ❌ No Legal Review | Liability risk (industry template) | 3 days | Legal |

**Total Effort:** 2-3 weeks (1 FTE)

**Decision Required:** ☐ Approve P0 sprint  ☐ Ship without P0 (not recommended)

---

## Proposed Timeline

### Option A: Ship with P0 Enhancements (RECOMMENDED)

```
Week 1-2: P0 Implementation (Monitoring, Runbook, Compat Tests, Reviews)
Week 3:   Final Review & CTO Sign-Off
Week 4:   🚀 GA RELEASE
Week 5-8: P1 Implementation (Shell Completion, Exit Codes, Piping, etc.)
Month 3+: P2 Backlog (Accessibility, i18n, Man Pages, etc.)
```

**Risk:** 🟢 LOW
**Timeline:** 4 weeks to GA
**Score:** 95/100 (Production-Grade)

### Option B: Ship Now, Fix Later (NOT RECOMMENDED)

```
Week 1:   🚀 GA RELEASE
Week 2-3: Incident response to production issues
Week 4+:  Retroactive P0 fixes while fighting fires
```

**Risk:** 🔴 HIGH
**Timeline:** 1 week to GA
**Score:** 82/100 (Technical-Grade, not Production-Grade)

### Option C: Ship with All Enhancements (OVERKILL)

```
Week 1-3: P0 Implementation
Week 4-7: P1 Implementation
Week 8-13: P2 Implementation
Week 14:  🚀 GA RELEASE
```

**Risk:** 🟢 MINIMAL (but opportunity cost high)
**Timeline:** 14 weeks to GA
**Score:** 98/100 (Best-in-Class, but delayed)

## CTO Decision Points

### Decision 1: Approve P0 Enhancement Sprint?

**Options:**
- ☐ **YES** - Approve 2-3 week sprint for P0 enhancements (REC-1 through REC-5)
- ☐ **NO** - Ship now, accept HIGH risk

**If YES:**
- Assign: 1 FTE for 2-3 weeks
- Budget: Monitoring tools (Datadog/Grafana), Security review (external vendor)
- Timeline: GA release in Week 4

**If NO:**
- Accept risk: Silent failures, breaking changes, security incidents possible
- Plan for reactive incident response

**Recommendation:** ✅ **APPROVE P0 SPRINT**

---

### Decision 2: Schedule P1 Enhancements?

**Options:**
- ☐ **Schedule Post-GA** - Immediate backlog (Week 5-8)
- ☐ **Defer to Q2** - Focus on other priorities first
- ☐ **Not Planned** - Ship with P0 only

**If Schedule Post-GA:**
- Assign: 1 FTE for 3-4 weeks
- Deliverables: Shell completion, exit codes, piping, help text, migration guides
- Outcome: DoD score increases to 98/100

**If Defer:**
- Risk: Users request features (shell completion, piping) via GitHub issues
- Impact: Perceived as "incomplete" CLI

**Recommendation:** ✅ **SCHEDULE POST-GA** (high user impact)

---

### Decision 3: Enhanced DoD Structure?

**Current DoD:** 11 sections (technical focus)

**Proposed Enhanced DoD:** 15 sections (adds operational maturity)
- Section 12: Operations & Support DoD
- Section 13: Release Management DoD
- Section 14: CLI-Specific Quality DoD
- Section 15: Compliance & Legal DoD

**Options:**
- ☐ **Adopt Enhanced DoD** - Use for all future FRMW tasks
- ☐ **Keep Current DoD** - Don't change existing structure
- ☐ **Hybrid** - Add sections selectively based on task type

**Recommendation:** ✅ **ADOPT ENHANCED DOD** (improves operational readiness across all tasks)
