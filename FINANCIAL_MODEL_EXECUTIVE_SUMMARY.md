## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES DRIVING FINANCIALS

### Why GreenLang Will Win

1. **First-Mover on CBAM**: 30-day deadline (Dec 30, 2025), zero mature competitors
2. **Zero-Hallucination Architecture**: Only platform with auditor-approved deterministic calculations
3. **Regulatory Depth Moat**: 2-year head start on competitors (CBAM, CSRD, EUDR)
4. **Hybrid Strategy**: Applications fund platform, de-risked path to "AWS for Climate"
5. **Sub-National Grid Coverage**: 141 regional grids (US, China, India, Mexico, EU) - industry-leading

### Why Low Churn (8-20%)

- **Regulatory Mandate**: Customers MUST comply with CSRD, CBAM, EUDR (can't churn)
- **3-Year Contracts**: Multi-year commitments with early termination penalties
- **Mission-Critical**: Emissions tracking, audit trails, compliance reporting
- **High Switching Costs**: Data integration, workflows, training, audit history

### Why High Expansion (70-115% NRR)

- **Upsells**: Starter → Professional → Enterprise (30-42%)
- **Cross-Sell**: Start with 1 app (CBAM) → Expand to 3+ apps (CSRD, Scope 3, EUDR) (25-38%)
- **Usage Expansion**: More suppliers, calculations, reports (15-35%)
- **Platform Adoption**: Custom agents on platform (10-20%)
