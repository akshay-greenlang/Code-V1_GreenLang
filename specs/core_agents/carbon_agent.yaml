  purpose: |
    Core infrastructure agent for aggregating carbon emissions from multiple sources
    and generating comprehensive emissions breakdowns with GHG Protocol compliance.

    This agent serves as the foundational carbon accounting component across all
    GreenLang workflows, providing deterministic emissions calculations, scope
    categorization (1/2/3), intensity metrics, and actionable reduction recommendations.

    The base CarbonAgent provides exact deterministic calculations, while the
    AI-enhanced CarbonAgentAI adds intelligent orchestration, natural language
    summaries, and context-aware recommendations.

  strategic_context:
    global_impact: "Carbon accounting is foundational to all climate action - every organization needs accurate emissions tracking"
    opportunity: "Automated, GHG Protocol-compliant carbon accounting reduces manual effort by 90% and improves accuracy"
    market_size: "$2B global carbon accounting software market, growing 15% annually"
    technology_maturity: "Production-ready deterministic calculations with AI enhancement layer"

  key_capabilities:
    - "Aggregate emissions from multiple fuel sources with exact calculations (no estimation)"
    - "Calculate total CO2e in kg and metric tons with 0.01 kg precision"
    - "Generate percentage breakdown by source (sorted by magnitude)"
    - "Calculate carbon intensity metrics (per sqft, per person, per production unit)"
    - "Categorize emissions by GHG Protocol scope (1/2/3) for compliance reporting"
    - "Generate actionable reduction recommendations prioritized by impact"
    - "Provide natural language executive summaries (AI version)"
    - "Full provenance tracking and audit trail for all calculations"
    - "GHG Protocol Corporate Standard and ISO 14064-1:2018 compliance"
    - "Support for hybrid calculations (deterministic base + AI insights)"

    You are a carbon accounting analyst for GreenLang, specializing in GHG Protocol
    compliance and emissions aggregation. You help organizations understand their
    carbon footprint through rigorous calculation and actionable insights.

    Your expertise includes:
    - GHG Protocol Corporate Standard (Scope 1, 2, 3)
    - ISO 14064-1:2018 carbon accounting
    - Carbon intensity benchmarking
    - Reduction strategy prioritization
    - Sustainability reporting (TCFD, CDP, GRI)

    CRITICAL RULES:
    - Use provided tools for ALL numeric calculations
    - NEVER estimate or guess numbers
    - Always explain analysis clearly with proper units
    - Provide actionable insights prioritized by impact
    - Ensure GHG Protocol compliance in all outputs
    - Format numbers clearly (e.g., "26,700 kg CO2e" not "26700.0")
    - Highlight the largest emission sources for quick wins

    Your responses should be:
    - Accurate: Tool-based calculations only
    - Actionable: Clear next steps
    - Compliant: GHG Protocol aligned
    - Concise: Executive-friendly summaries

  user_prompt_template: |
    Analyze and aggregate carbon emissions from multiple sources:

    Data Summary:
    - Number of emission sources: {num_sources}
    - Building area: {building_area} sqft (if applicable)
    - Occupancy: {occupancy} people (if applicable)
    - Reporting period: {time_period}

    Tasks:
    1. Use aggregate_emissions tool to calculate total emissions (kg and tons)
    2. Use calculate_breakdown tool to get percentage breakdown by source
    3. Use categorize_scope tool to assign GHG Protocol scopes (1, 2, 3)
    4. Use calculate_intensity tool to get intensity metrics (if building data provided)
    5. Use generate_recommendations tool to get top 3 reduction recommendations
    6. Use validate_emissions_data tool to check data quality and compliance

    7. Provide an executive summary with:
       - Total footprint statement (highlight if high/medium/low)
       - Key insights from breakdown (what are the major sources?)
       - Scope categorization summary (compliance-ready)
       - Notable intensity metrics vs. industry benchmarks (if available)
       - Top 3 actionable recommendations prioritized by impact
       - Data quality assessment

    IMPORTANT:
    - Use tools for ALL numeric calculations
    - Do not estimate or guess any numbers
    - Format numbers clearly (e.g., "23,500 kg" not "23500.0")
    - Focus on actionable insights in your summary
    - Ensure GHG Protocol compliance in scope assignments
    - Highlight quick wins (high impact, low effort)

    summary: |
      Total carbon footprint: 26.700 metric tons CO2e
      Breakdown by source:
        - electricity: 15.000 tons (56.18%)
        - natural_gas: 8.500 tons (31.84%)
        - diesel: 3.200 tons (11.99%)
    ai_summary: |
      The building's carbon footprint totals 26.7 metric tons CO2e annually, which is
      within typical range for a 50,000 sqft commercial building. Electricity is the
      dominant source at 56%, followed by natural gas at 32% and diesel at 12%.

      Carbon intensity is 0.53 kg/sqft and 134 kg/person, slightly above average for
      similar buildings. This indicates room for efficiency improvements.

      Key opportunity: Addressing electricity (solar PV or RECs) and natural gas
      (heat pumps or envelope upgrades) could reduce emissions by up to 70% over
      7-10 years. Quick win: Energy efficiency measures in lighting and HVAC could
      deliver 10-15% reduction within 1 year at low cost.

      Data quality: All emissions data validated. GHG Protocol compliant (Scope 1: 44%,
      Scope 2: 56%). Ready for sustainability reporting (CDP, GRI, TCFD).
