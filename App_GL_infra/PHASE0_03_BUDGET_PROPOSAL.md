## üéØ FINANCIAL RISK MITIGATION

### Scenario Planning

#### Best Case Scenario (80% probability)
- Framework delivers 70% contribution on schedule
- 60 agents built in Year 1
- Enterprise adoption exceeds projections
- **Net Profit Year 1:** $520,000 (ROI: 137%)

#### Base Case Scenario (Expected)
- Framework delivers 60-70% contribution
- 50 agents built in Year 1
- Moderate enterprise adoption
- **Net Profit Year 1:** $370,000 (ROI: 97%)

#### Worst Case Scenario (10% probability)
- Framework delivers only 50% contribution
- 35 agents built in Year 1
- Low enterprise adoption
- **Net Profit Year 1:** $145,000 (ROI: 38%)
- **Still profitable!**

### Downside Protection

**If project fails to meet targets:**
1. **Month 2 Gate:** If Tier 1 doesn't deliver 50%, can stop at $154K investment
2. **Month 3 Gate:** If Tier 2 doesn't deliver 60%, can stop at $205K investment
3. **Month 5 Gate:** If Tier 3 doesn't deliver 70%, can skip Tier 4 polish

**Even in worst case (stop at Tier 1):**
- Investment: $154,000
- 50% framework still beats competitors (40%)
- Break-even at 11 agents (achievable)

**Downside is limited; upside is enormous.**
