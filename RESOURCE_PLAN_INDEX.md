## QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### Q: Why 5 apps by Dec 2026, not 6?

**A:** Each app needs 36-48 weeks of development + 4-6 weeks QA + 2-4 weeks beta = 8-10 months minimum. If you start App #6 in April 2026, it ships January 2027. If you force it to December 2026, you'd need to:
- Reduce team size on other apps (quality suffers)
- Cut App #6 scope dramatically (risk customer disappointment)
- Run unsustainable 60+ hour weeks (team burnout)

Realistic answer: 5 apps by Dec 2026 (exceeds $15M target at $18M), 6 by Jan 2027.

---

### Q: What if we can't hire 33 people in 9 months?

**A:** That's the #1 risk identified in the plan. Fallback options:
- Hire 20 people → Only build 4 apps by Dec 2026 (still $1M+ MRR)
- Hire contractors/fractional teams → Extend timeline but reduce FTE burden
- Offshore hiring → 30% cost savings but integration time needed
- Slow hiring to 2-3/month → Stretch timeline to mid-2027 for 6 apps

**Key point:** The plan is scalable. If hiring is 60% of target, you still hit $1M+ MRR.

---

### Q: How do we maintain culture with 4x team size?

**A:** Build culture intentionally:
1. **Onboarding:** Structured 2-week program, not ad-hoc
2. **Values:** GreenLang-First architecture is a technical + cultural commitment
3. **Communication:** Weekly all-hands, transparent goals, clear decision-making
4. **Mentorship:** Senior engineers assigned 1:1 to each new hire
5. **Community:** Monthly team events, quarterly off-site
6. **Hiring:** Only hire people who share climate mission & technical excellence

**Key insight:** Fast growth breaks bad cultures. Great cultures grow faster. Focus on hiring people who fit.

---

### Q: What's the biggest risk?

**A:** Team scaling. You need to hire 4 people/month for 9 months. That's 33 people in competitive talent market. If you only hire 2/month, the entire plan slips 6 months.

**Mitigation:**
- Start recruiting immediately (Nov 11)
- Offer 15-25% above market salary
- Build referral pipeline aggressively
- Consider contractors/offshore for some roles

---

### Q: How much does this plan cost?

**A:** $10M total Year 1:
- Salaries: $6.4M (33 engineers × avg $190K + benefits)
- Infrastructure: $1.35M (AWS, monitoring, databases)
- Tools & Services: $400K (development tools, marketing, etc.)
- Marketing & Sales: $1M (customer acquisition, marketing)
- Contractors/Misc: $800K (freelancers, contingency)

**Funding requirement:** Series B close by Q1 2026 at $50M.

---

### Q: When do we become EBITDA positive?

**A:** November 2026 (Month 13 of the plan).

At that point:
- Revenue: $1.5M MRR ($18M ARR)
- Engineering team: 43 people
- Infrastructure: Scaled to 10K concurrent users
- Gross margin: ~70% (typical SaaS)
- Payback period for Series B investment: ~3 years

---

### Q: What if VCCI slips?

**A:** VCCI is the critical path. Any slip cascades to Apps #4, #5, #6.

**Impact analysis:**
- VCCI slips 2 weeks → App #4 slips 2 weeks
- VCCI slips 4 weeks → App #4 slips 4 weeks, App #5 slips 2 weeks
- VCCI slips 8 weeks → App #4 slips 8 weeks, App #5 slips 6 weeks, App #6 still Jan 2027

**Mitigation:** Dedicate 5-6 engineers to VCCI NOW (don't wait for hiring). Monitor progress weekly. If slipping, escalate immediately.
