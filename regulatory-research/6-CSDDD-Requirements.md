## Risk Assessment Methodology

### Impact Prioritization Matrix
```
Priority Score = Severity × Scale × Irremediability × Likelihood

Where:
- Severity: 1-5 (minor to severe)
- Scale: Number of people/area affected
- Irremediability: 1-5 (reversible to permanent)
- Likelihood: 1-5 (rare to certain)
```

### Value Chain Risk Mapping
```
Risk Level = Country Risk × Sector Risk × Relationship Influence

Country Risk factors:
- Rule of law index
- Human rights records
- Environmental performance
- Corruption perception

Sector Risk factors:
- Labor intensity
- Environmental impact
- Regulatory compliance
- Supply chain complexity
```

### Supplier Risk Scoring
```
Supplier Risk = Inherent Risk × Control Effectiveness

Inherent Risk based on:
- Location
- Industry
- Production processes
- Subcontracting

Control Effectiveness:
- Management systems
- Certifications
- Audit results
- Corrective actions
```
