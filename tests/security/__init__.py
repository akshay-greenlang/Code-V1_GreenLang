Security Penetration Testing Module for GreenLang

This module provides security testing infrastructure for:
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Injection attacks (SQL, command)
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) tests

All tests are designed to be run in a controlled environment
and should NOT be executed against production systems.
