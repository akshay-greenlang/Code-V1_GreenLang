- **Wheel**: `dist/greenlang-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl` (481KB)
- **Source**: `dist/greenlang-0.2.0.tar.gz` (524KB)
- **Status**: Both pass `twine check` ✅

### 2. Configuration Files Updated
- `pyproject.toml`: Fixed entry points, static version, proper dependencies
- `MANIFEST.in`: Includes all package data correctly
- `VERSION`: Set to 0.2.0
- `core/greenlang/cli/main.py`: Fixed Typer sub-command structure

### 3. CI/CD Workflow
- **File**: `.github/workflows/release-build.yml`
- **Features**:
  - OS matrix testing (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
  - Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 support
  - SBOM generation with syft
  - Sigstore signing for releases
  - Automated verification of `gl` CLI

## Verification Results

### ✅ Installation Test
```bash
pip install dist/greenlang-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl
# Successfully installed greenlang-0.2.0
```

### ✅ CLI Commands Working
```bash
gl --help         # ✅ Shows command list
gl version        # ✅ Shows "GreenLang v0.2.0"
gl doctor         # ✅ Shows environment check
gl pack --help    # ✅ Shows pack subcommands
gl pack list      # ✅ Lists packs (with minor warnings)
```

### ✅ Python Import Test
```python
import core.greenlang
print(core.greenlang.__version__)  # Output: 0.2.0
from core.greenlang import PackRegistry, PackLoader, Executor  # ✅ Works
```

## Issues Fixed from CTO's Plan

1. **Entry Point Conflict**: Fixed mismatch between `pyproject.toml` and `setup.py`
2. **Package Structure**: Resolved dual greenlang module confusion
3. **Missing Dependencies**: Added `packaging>=22.0`
4. **CLI Structure**: Fixed Typer sub-application for pack commands
5. **Version Management**: Consolidated to static version 0.2.0

## Known Minor Issues (Non-blocking)

1. **Cryptography Warning**: "cryptography library not available, using mock signing"
   - This is expected in minimal installation
   - Full signing works when cryptography is installed

2. **Pack Validation Warnings**: Some demo packs have validation errors
   - These are in the source packs, not the packaging
   - Does not affect core functionality

## Next Steps for Release

1. **Push to Git**:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "feat: complete v0.2.0 packaging with working gl CLI"
   git tag v0.2.0
   git push origin chore/tests-structure-and-coverage --tags
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions**: The CI workflow will automatically:
   - Build and verify on 3 OSes
   - Generate SBOM
   - Sign artifacts (on tag push)

3. **PyPI Upload** (when ready):
   ```bash
   twine upload dist/*
   ```
