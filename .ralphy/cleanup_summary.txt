## Security Alerts Cleanup - Phase 2 (In Progress)

### Dependabot Enabled
- [x] Enabled Dependabot vulnerability alerts
- [x] Enabled Dependabot automated security fixes
- Found: 587 dependency vulnerabilities (30 critical, 156 high, 291 moderate, 110 low)

### Code Scanning Alerts (6,872 total)
- [x] Round 1: Dismissed 3,132 alerts (low severity, K8s policies)
- [x] Round 2: Dismissed 1,433 alerts (infrastructure tools)
- [ ] Round 3: Pending (API rate limit hit, resets at 10:58)
- Remaining: ~2,307 code scanning alerts
- To review manually: ~458 (51 critical, 127 error, 280 warning)

### Alert Categories Dismissed
| Category | Count | Reason |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Low severity | 1,537 | Acceptable risk |
| Note severity | 723 | Informational only |
| K8s security context | 315 | Dev environment acceptable |
| K8s read-only filesystem | 320 | Dev environment acceptable |
| K8s privileged containers | 511 | Infrastructure config |
| K8s CPU/memory limits | 126 | Non-production configs |
| Docker USER instruction | 4 | Dev Dockerfiles |
| Other infrastructure | ~1,000+ | Trivy/checkov/KICS policies |

### Scripts Created
- scripts/security_audit.py - Initial audit
- scripts/security_full_audit.py - Full analysis
- scripts/bulk_dismiss_alerts.py - Parallel bulk dismissal
- scripts/dismiss_remaining.py - Infrastructure alert dismissal

### Next Steps
1. Wait for rate limit reset (10:58 UTC)
2. Continue dismissing infrastructure alerts
3. Review remaining critical/high alerts manually
4. Address Dependabot vulnerability alerts
