- **Status**: International Standard

## Overview

The GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard provides requirements and guidance for companies and organizations preparing a corporate-level GHG emissions inventory.

## Scope Classifications

### Scope 1: Direct GHG Emissions

Direct greenhouse gas emissions occur from sources that are owned or controlled by the company. Examples include:

- **Stationary combustion**: Emissions from fuel combustion in boilers, furnaces, burners, turbines, heaters, incinerators, engines, flares
- **Mobile combustion**: Emissions from company-owned or controlled vehicles (cars, trucks, ships, aircraft, trains)
- **Process emissions**: Physical or chemical processes (cement production, aluminum smelting, waste processing)
- **Fugitive emissions**: Intentional or unintentional releases (equipment leaks, refrigeration and air conditioning losses)

### Scope 2: Indirect GHG Emissions from Energy

Scope 2 accounts for GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heat, or cooling consumed by the reporting company.

Key principles:
- Emissions physically occur at the facility where electricity is generated
- Reported separately from Scope 1 to avoid double counting
- Location-based and market-based calculation methods available

### Scope 3: Other Indirect GHG Emissions

Scope 3 is an optional reporting category that allows for the treatment of all other indirect emissions. Categories include:

1. Purchased goods and services
2. Capital goods
3. Fuel and energy-related activities
4. Upstream transportation and distribution
5. Waste generated in operations
6. Business travel
7. Employee commuting
8. Upstream leased assets
9. Downstream transportation and distribution
10. Processing of sold products
11. Use of sold products
12. End-of-life treatment of sold products
13. Downstream leased assets
14. Franchises
15. Investments

## Accounting Principles

The GHG Protocol is based on five accounting principles:

1. **Relevance**: Ensure the inventory appropriately reflects emissions and serves decision-making needs
2. **Completeness**: Account for all emission sources and activities within the chosen inventory boundary
3. **Consistency**: Use consistent methodologies for meaningful comparisons over time
4. **Transparency**: Address relevant issues in a factual and coherent manner
5. **Accuracy**: Reduce bias and uncertainties as far as practical

## Emission Factors

### Natural Gas Combustion
- **Emission Factor**: 53.06 kg CO₂/mmBtu (HHV basis)
- **Methane**: 1.0 g CH₄/mmBtu
- **Nitrous Oxide**: 0.1 g N₂O/mmBtu

### Diesel Fuel (Distillate Fuel Oil)
- **Emission Factor**: 73.96 kg CO₂/mmBtu
- **Density**: ~0.85 kg/L
- **Energy Content**: ~38.6 MJ/L (10.7 kWh/L)

### Electricity (US Grid Average)
- **Location-based factor**: ~0.4 kg CO₂e/kWh (varies by region)
- **Market-based factor**: Depends on supplier-specific contracts

## Organizational Boundaries

Companies must choose an approach to consolidate GHG emissions:

### Equity Share Approach
Account for GHG emissions from operations according to the company's share of equity in the operation.

### Control Approach
Account for 100% of GHG emissions from operations over which the company has control. Two types:

- **Financial control**: Company has ability to direct financial and operating policies
- **Operational control**: Company or subsidiary has full authority to introduce and implement operating policies

## Verification and Assurance

The standard recommends third-party verification for:
- Enhanced credibility
- Management tool for improving inventory quality
- Preparation for potential regulatory requirements
- Stakeholder confidence

Common verification standards:
- ISO 14064-3: Greenhouse gases - Part 3: Specification with guidance for validation and verification
- ISAE 3410: Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements

## Reporting Requirements

### Minimum Reporting Requirements
1. Description of organization and inventory boundary
2. Reporting period covered
3. Emissions from Scope 1 and Scope 2 separately
4. Direct CO₂ emissions from biologically sequestered carbon separately
5. Methodologies used for emissions calculations
6. Reference to calculation tools used

### Recommended Additional Reporting
- Scope 3 emissions
- Performance metrics (intensity ratios)
- Emissions by business unit, facility, or country
- Emissions by scope and GHG type
- Emissions reduction targets and progress
- Contextual information on business growth
