## KEY CAPABILITIES

### 1. Boiler Efficiency Auditing (ASME PTC 4.1)
- **Stack loss analysis:** Flue gas temperature, O2 content, combustion efficiency
- **Radiation/convection losses:** Surface temperature measurements
- **Cycling losses:** Start-stop inefficiency quantification
- **Overall efficiency:** Combustion efficiency × (1 - radiation losses) × (1 - cycling losses)

### 2. Technology Comparison (8 Tools)
1. `calculate_boiler_efficiency` - ASME PTC 4.1 method with stack loss
2. `estimate_annual_fuel_savings` - Fuel reduction from high-efficiency replacement
3. `compare_replacement_technologies` - Solar thermal vs heat pump vs hybrid
4. `calculate_retrofit_requirements` - Piping, space, electrical, controls
5. `estimate_replacement_cost` - CAPEX with installation and integration
6. `calculate_financial_metrics` - Payback, NPV, IRR, lifecycle cost
7. `assess_retrofit_risks` - Downtime, compatibility, safety
8. `generate_replacement_roadmap` - Phased implementation with milestones

### 3. Retrofit Integration Analysis
- **Piping modifications:** Existing steam/hot water distribution assessment
- **Space requirements:** Footprint analysis for new equipment
- **Electrical upgrades:** Heat pump power requirements
- **Controls integration:** BMS compatibility and sensor upgrades
- **Downtime minimization:** Phased cutover strategies

### 4. Financial Optimization

## TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE

### Thermodynamic Foundation:
- **Combustion efficiency:** η_comb = 1 - (Stack loss + Radiation loss + Incomplete combustion)
- **Stack loss:** L_stack = K × (T_stack - T_amb) / (CO2 + 0.5×CO)
- **ASME PTC 4.1:** Industry-standard boiler efficiency testing methodology
- **Heat rate degradation:** Age-based efficiency decline models

### Technology Database:
- **High-efficiency condensing boilers:** 90-98% efficiency (vs. 75-82% old)
- **Solar thermal hybrid:** 30-70% solar fraction depending on temperature
- **Industrial heat pumps:** COP 2.5-4.0 for <100°C applications
- **Electric boilers:** 99%+ efficiency, zero onsite emissions

### Retrofit Considerations:
- **Parallel operation:** Run new system alongside old during commissioning
- **Pipe sizing:** Flow rate compatibility analysis
- **Pressure matching:** Steam pressure conversion if needed
- **Safety interlocks:** Emergency shutdown procedures
