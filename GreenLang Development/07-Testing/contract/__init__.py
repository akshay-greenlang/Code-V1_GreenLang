Contract Testing Module for GreenLang

This module provides contract testing infrastructure for validating:
- API contracts (REST, GraphQL)
- Event schema contracts
- gRPC service contracts

Contract testing ensures that provider and consumer services
maintain compatible interfaces as they evolve independently.
