  description:
    tagline: Zero-hallucination EU CBAM compliance reporting
    short: 'Complete end-to-end solution for EU CBAM Transitional Registry reporting

      with 100% calculation accuracy and full audit trail.

      '
    long: 'The CBAM Importer Copilot transforms raw shipment data into submission-ready

      EU CBAM Transitional Registry reports in under 10 minutes.


      Built with a ZERO HALLUCINATION architecture that guarantees 100% calculation

      accuracy through deterministic database lookups and Python arithmetic (no LLM

      for numeric operations).


      Perfect for EU importers of carbon-intensive goods (steel, cement, aluminum,

      fertilizers, hydrogen) who need to comply with quarterly CBAM reporting

      requirements during the transitional period (Q4 2023 - Q4 2025).


      Key Features:

      - 3-agent pipeline (Intake → Calculate → Report)

      - <10 minute processing for 10,000 shipments

      - 50+ automated CBAM compliance validations

      - Complete audit trail and provenance

      - Multi-format input support (CSV, JSON, Excel)

      - Human-readable summaries + machine-readable JSON
