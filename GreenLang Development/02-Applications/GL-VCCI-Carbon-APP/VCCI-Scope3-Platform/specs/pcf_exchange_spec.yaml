  description: >
    Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) exchange service supporting PACT Pathfinder v2.0,
    Catena-X, and SAP SDX for bidirectional PCF sharing with suppliers and customers.

  purpose: >
    PCF Exchange creates network effects: import supplier PCFs (Tier 3 → Tier 1
    upgrade), export our PCFs to customers, establish VCCI as central PCF hub
    in value chains. Target: 30% of Cat 1 spend covered by supplier PCFs by Q2 post-launch.

# BUSINESS VALUE
# ============================================================================
business_value:
  problem_solved: >
    Category 1 (Purchased Goods) typically accounts for 70% of Scope 3 emissions,
    but most companies lack supplier-specific PCFs. Without PCF sharing,
    calculations rely on Tier 3 (spend-based) or Tier 2 (average-data) methods
    with ±50% or ±20% uncertainty. Supplier engagement is manual and slow.

  solution: >
    PCF Exchange automates bidirectional PCF sharing via industry standards
    (PACT Pathfinder, Catena-X, SAP SDX). Import supplier PCFs to upgrade
    Tier 3 → Tier 1 (±50% → ±5% uncertainty). Export our PCFs to customers.
    Create network effects: more suppliers sharing = more value.
