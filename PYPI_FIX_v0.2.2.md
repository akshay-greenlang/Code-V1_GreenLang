# Critical PyPI Description Fix - v0.2.2 Release

## Problem Identified
The PyPI page for greenlang-cli v0.2.1 was showing **completely wrong content**:
- Displayed Syft (SBOM tool) documentation instead of GreenLang
- No mention of Climate Intelligence Infrastructure
- Missing all GreenLang features and capabilities
- Users visiting PyPI saw incorrect project information

## Root Cause
The README.md file contained the entire Syft project documentation instead of GreenLang's proper documentation. This was likely due to an accidental file replacement during development.

## Fixes Applied in v0.2.2

### 1. Complete README Replacement
- **Removed**: All Syft-related content (188 lines of wrong documentation)
- **Added**: Proper GreenLang Climate Intelligence Framework documentation
- **Includes**:
  - Clear project description as Climate Intelligence Framework
  - Installation instructions for greenlang-cli
  - Quick start examples with CLI and Python SDK
  - Core concepts (Packs, Agents, Pipelines)
  - Real-world applications
  - Community links

### 2. Enhanced Project Metadata in pyproject.toml
- **Updated version**: 0.2.1 → 0.2.2
- **Enhanced description**: "The Climate Intelligence Framework - Build climate-aware applications with AI-driven orchestration"
- **Added keywords**: 16 relevant keywords including "climate", "emissions", "sustainability", "AI", "orchestration"
- **Added classifiers**:
  - Development Status :: 4 - Beta
  - Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Atmospheric Science
  - Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries :: Application Frameworks
- **Added project URLs**:
  - Homepage: https://greenlang.io
  - Documentation: https://greenlang.io/docs
  - Repository: https://github.com/greenlang/greenlang
  - Bug Tracker: https://github.com/greenlang/greenlang/issues
  - Discord: https://discord.gg/greenlang

### 3. Version Synchronization
- Updated VERSION file: 0.2.1 → 0.2.2
- Ensured version consistency across all files

## Quality Checks Completed
✅ Package builds successfully with `python -m build`
✅ README renders correctly (verified with `twine check`)
✅ All metadata properly formatted
✅ No build warnings or errors
✅ Package size: ~585 KB (optimized)
