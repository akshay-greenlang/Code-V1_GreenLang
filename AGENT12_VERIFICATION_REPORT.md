   - **Effort:** 4 hours
   - **Priority:** MEDIUM

3. **Dimension 7 (Deployment Readiness) - 9/10:**
   - **Gap:** Pack validation not run
   - **Action:** Run GL-PackQC validation
   - **Effort:** 1 hour
   - **Priority:** MEDIUM

### Nice-to-Have Improvements

1. **Dimension 3 (Test Coverage) - 13/15:**
   - **Gap:** Actual coverage not measured

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. ✅ **Deploy to Staging Environment**
   - Test operational monitoring
   - Validate pack configuration
   - Run end-to-end integration tests

2. ✅ **Add Health Check Method**
   ```python
   def health_check(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
       """Agent health status for monitoring."""
       return {
           "status": "healthy",
           "version": "1.0.0",
           "provider": "openai",
           "last_check": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
       }
   ```

3. ✅ **Run Coverage Report**
