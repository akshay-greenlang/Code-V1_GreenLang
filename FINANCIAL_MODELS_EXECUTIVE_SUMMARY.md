   - $8.7B exit value (vs. $5.5B A, $12B B)
   - 82x MOIC for Series A (vs. 55x A, 120x B)

2. **Fastest to Profitability**
   - Jul 2027 (vs. Aug 2027 A/B)
   - 15% margin in Year 2 (vs. -4% A, 9% B)

3. **Staged De-Risking**
   - Prove PMF with apps first
   - Platform expansion validated by customer demand
   - Can pivot if platform doesn't work

   - $620M ARR by 2030
   - 70% EBITDA margins
   - 140:1 LTV:CAC by Year 5
   - 158% Rule of 40
