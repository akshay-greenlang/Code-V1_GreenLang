## 3. UNIT ECONOMICS & CUSTOMER METRICS

### 3.1 Customer Acquisition Economics

#### 3.1.1 Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

| Metric | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 | Benchmark |
|--------|------|------|------|------|------|------|-----------|
| **Total S&M Spend** | $5M | $11M | $22M | $42M | $66M | $86M | N/A |
| **New Customers** | 100 | 750 | 4,250 | 5,000 | 15,000 | 25,000 | N/A |
| **CAC (Blended)** | $50K | $15K | $5.2K | $8.4K | $4.4K | $3.4K | <$100K (enterprise) |
| **CAC by Segment** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| - Starter (SMB) | N/A | $3K | $2K | $1.5K | $1K | $800 | <$3K |
| - Professional (Mid-Market) | N/A | $20K | $12K | $10K | $8K | $6K | <$30K |
| - Enterprise | $50K | $60K | $55K | $65K | $70K | $75K | <$100K |
| **CAC Payback Period** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| - Starter | N/A | 6 months | 4 months | 3 months | 2 months | 2 months | <18 months |
| - Professional | N/A | 12 months | 10 months | 8 months | 7 months | 6 months | <18 months |
| - Enterprise | 24 months | 18 months | 15 months | 14 months | 13 months | 12 months | <24 months |

**Key Insights:**
- **Blended CAC decreases from $50K (2025) to $3.4K (2030)** due to:
  - Product-led growth (PLG) reducing acquisition costs
  - Platform viral loops (developers recruiting developers)
  - Strong word-of-mouth and organic growth
- **Enterprise CAC increases slightly** due to:
  - Moving upmarket to larger enterprises ($1M+ ACV)
  - More complex sales cycles requiring SEs, proof-of-concepts
  - Higher touch required for enterprise deals

#### 3.1.2 Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

| Metric | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 | Benchmark |
|--------|------|------|------|------|------|------|-----------|
| **Average Revenue Per Account (ARPA)** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| - Starter (SMB) | N/A | $6K/yr | $6K/yr | $7K/yr | $8K/yr | $9K/yr | $5-15K |
| - Professional (Mid-Market) | N/A | $60K/yr | $65K/yr | $70K/yr | $75K/yr | $80K/yr | $50-100K |
| - Enterprise | $30K/yr | $120K/yr | $150K/yr | $180K/yr | $200K/yr | $220K/yr | $100K-1M+ |
| **Gross Margin** | 65% | 75% | 80% | 85% | 88% | 90% | 70%+ |
| **Annual Churn Rate** | 25% | 20% | 15% | 12% | 10% | 8% | <15% |
| **Customer Lifespan (years)** | 4 | 5 | 6.7 | 8.3 | 10 | 12.5 | 5+ years |
| **LTV Calculation** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| - Starter | N/A | $22.5K | $32K | $49K | $70K | $101K | $30K+ |
| - Professional | N/A | $225K | $347K | $490K | $660K | $900K | $300K+ |
| - Enterprise | $78K | $450K | $800K | $1.26M | $1.76M | $2.48M | $500K+ |
| **Weighted Avg LTV** | $78K | $150K | $320K | $580K | $940K | $1.38M | $500K+ |

**LTV Calculation Method:**
```
LTV = (ARPA × Gross Margin) / Annual Churn Rate
Example for Enterprise 2030:
LTV = ($220K × 90%) / 8% = $198K / 0.08 = $2.48M
```

#### 3.1.3 LTV:CAC Ratio

| Metric | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 | Benchmark |
|--------|------|------|------|------|------|------|-----------|
| **LTV (Weighted Avg)** | $78K | $150K | $320K | $580K | $940K | $1.38M | $500K+ |
| **CAC (Blended)** | $50K | $15K | $5.2K | $8.4K | $4.4K | $3.4K | <$100K |
| **LTV:CAC Ratio** | **1.6:1** | **10:1** | **62:1** | **69:1** | **214:1** | **406:1** | **3:1+** |
| **Target LTV:CAC** | 2:1+ | 5:1+ | 10:1+ | 15:1+ | 20:1+ | 25:1+ | 3:1+ |

**Key Insights:**
- **LTV:CAC improves dramatically** from 1.6:1 (2025) to 406:1 (2030)
- **2025 ratio (1.6:1) below target** due to:
  - Early-stage pilot pricing (discounted contracts)
  - High founder-led sales costs
  - Low gross margins (65%) due to infrastructure inefficiencies
- **2026+ ratios far exceed benchmarks** due to:
  - Product-led growth reducing CAC
  - Multi-year contracts increasing LTV
  - Network effects (platform)
  - Low churn due to regulatory compliance (customers MUST use product)

### 3.2 Net Revenue Retention (NRR)

| Metric | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 | Benchmark |
|--------|------|------|------|------|------|-----------|
| **Starting ARR (cohort)** | $3M | $21M | $75M | $184M | $380M | N/A |
| **Gross Churn** | -20% | -15% | -12% | -10% | -8% | <15% |
| **Gross Revenue Lost** | -$600K | -$3.15M | -$9M | -$18.4M | -$30.4M | N/A |
| **Expansion Revenue** |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| - Upsells (higher tier) | +30% | +35% | +38% | +40% | +42% | +20-30% |
| - Cross-sell (new apps) | +25% | +30% | +32% | +35% | +38% | +10-20% |
| - Usage expansion | +15% | +20% | +25% | +30% | +35% | +5-15% |
| **Total Expansion** | +70% | +85% | +95% | +105% | +115% | +40%+ |
| **Expansion Revenue** | +$2.1M | +$17.85M | +$71.25M | +$193.2M | +$437M | N/A |
| **Net Revenue Retention (NRR)** | **150%** | **170%** | **183%** | **195%** | **207%** | **120%+** |

**NRR Calculation Example (2027):**
```
Starting ARR (2026 cohort): $21M
- Gross Churn (15%): -$3.15M
+ Expansion (85%): +$17.85M
= Ending ARR from 2026 cohort: $35.7M
NRR = $35.7M / $21M = 170%
```

**Key Drivers of High NRR:**
1. **Low Churn** (8-20%):
   - Regulatory compliance mandate (customers MUST comply, can't churn)
   - 3-year contracts with penalties for early termination
   - Switching costs (data integration, workflows, training)
   - Mission-critical system (emissions tracking, audit trails)

2. **High Expansion** (70-115%):
   - **Upsells**: Starter → Professional → Enterprise (30-42%)
   - **Cross-sell**: Start with 1 app (CBAM), expand to 3+ apps (CSRD, Scope 3, EUDR) (25-38%)
   - **Usage expansion**: More suppliers, more calculations, more reports (15-35%)
   - **Platform adoption**: Customers build custom agents on platform (10-20%)

### 3.3 Rule of 40 Analysis

| Metric | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 | Benchmark |
|--------|------|------|------|------|------|-----------|
| **ARR Growth Rate** | 600% | 257% | 145% | 107% | 63% | >20% |
| **EBITDA Margin** | -135% | -36% | -1% | +26% | +45% | >0% |
| **Rule of 40 Score** | **465** | **221** | **144** | **133** | **108** | **>40** |
| **Target Rule of 40** | 40 | 40 | 40 | 40 | 40 | 40 |
| **Interpretation** | Hypergrowth | Hypergrowth | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent | Good |

**Key Insights:**
- **All years exceed Rule of 40** (target >40)
- **2026-2027**: Extreme hypergrowth phase (600%+ growth), negative margins acceptable
- **2028**: Transition year (145% growth, -1% margin = 144 score)
- **2029-2030**: Balanced growth + profitability (63-107% growth, 26-45% margin)
