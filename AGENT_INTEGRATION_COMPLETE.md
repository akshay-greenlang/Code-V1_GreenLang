# Agent Integration Complete

## Summary
All 11 agents have been successfully integrated across the entire GreenLang codebase.

## Agents Available
1. **BaseAgent** - Abstract base class for all agents
2. **InputValidatorAgent** - Validates input data for emissions calculations
3. **FuelAgent** - Calculates emissions based on fuel consumption
4. **BoilerAgent** - Calculates emissions from boilers and thermal systems
5. **CarbonAgent** - Aggregates emissions and provides carbon footprint
6. **ReportAgent** - Generates carbon footprint reports
7. **BenchmarkAgent** - Compares emissions against industry benchmarks
8. **GridFactorAgent** - Retrieves country-specific emission factors
9. **BuildingProfileAgent** - Categorizes buildings and expected performance
10. **IntensityAgent** - Calculates emission intensity metrics
11. **RecommendationAgent** - Provides optimization recommendations

## Files Updated
1. **greenlang/cli/main.py** - Added BoilerAgent registration in orchestrator
2. **greenlang/cli/assistant.py** - Imported and registered all agents including BoilerAgent
3. **greenlang/sdk/enhanced_client.py** - Already had all agents registered
4. **greenlang/agents/__init__.py** - Already exports all agents
5. **GREENLANG_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Already documents all agents
6. **COMMANDS_REFERENCE.md** - Already includes all agent commands

## Verification Complete
- All agents can be imported successfully
- All agents can be registered in the orchestrator
- `gl agents` command shows all 10 functional agents
- `gl agent boiler` command works correctly
- Test script confirms all agents are properly configured

## Test Results
```
Testing all GreenLang agents...
==================================================
1. Testing imports: All 10 agents imported successfully
2. Testing agent registration: All 10 agents registered successfully
3. Verifying registered agents: Total 10 agents registered
4. All agents are accessible via CLI commands
==================================================
[SUCCESS] All tests passed! All agents are properly configured.
```

## CLI Commands Available
```bash
# List all agents
gl agents

# Show details for any agent
greenlang agent validator
greenlang agent fuel
greenlang agent boiler
greenlang agent carbon
greenlang agent report
greenlang agent benchmark
greenlang agent grid_factor
greenlang agent building_profile
greenlang agent intensity
greenlang agent recommendation
```

## SDK Usage
```python
from greenlang.sdk import GreenLangClient

client = GreenLangClient(region="US")
# All agents are automatically registered and available
```

## Issue Resolution
The main issue was that BoilerAgent was not being registered in the main CLI orchestrator. This has been fixed by:
1. Ensuring BoilerAgent is imported in main.py and assistant.py
2. Registering BoilerAgent with the orchestrator in the run() function
3. All agents are now consistently available across CLI, SDK, and programmatic access
