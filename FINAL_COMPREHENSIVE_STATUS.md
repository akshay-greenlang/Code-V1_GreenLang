## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked

1. **Systematic expansion**: Building by sector with clear targets
2. **Quality gates**: Every factor verified before inclusion
3. **Free sources**: 100+ authoritative sources identified
4. **Geographic priority**: Sub-national coverage differentiates us
5. **Technology focus**: Renewable energy & storage critical for future

### What's Hard

1. **Scale**: 10,000 factors is massive - requires dedicated effort
2. **Manual curation**: Each factor needs research, extraction, formatting
3. **Source verification**: URIs must be checked and working
4. **Regional variations**: Multiplies factor count significantly
5. **Maintenance**: Data becomes outdated; need update strategy

### Keys to Success

1. **Be honest**: Real numbers, real sources, real capabilities
2. **Build systematically**: One sector at a time, high quality
3. **Leverage free data**: Government, academic, industry association
4. **Focus on differentiators**: Sub-national, renewables, storage
5. **Deploy incrementally**: 2K → 5K → 10K, not all at once
