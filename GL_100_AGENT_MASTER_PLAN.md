## PART 7: RISK MANAGEMENT

### 7.1 Critical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Spec generation bottleneck** | HIGH | MEDIUM | Parallel teams, template reuse, AI-assisted generation |
| **Test coverage target not met** | MEDIUM | HIGH | Prioritize P0 agents first, automate test generation |
| **Agent Factory delays** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Manual implementation fallback, incremental factory deployment |
| **Team velocity slower than planned** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Add contractors, simplify complex agents, extend timeline if needed |
| **Budget overruns** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Aggressive LLM caching, cheaper models for testing, budget caps |

### 7.2 Contingency Plans

**If Test Coverage Falls Behind:**
- Adjust target to 70% minimum (vs 80%)
- Focus on P0 Critical agents (must be 80%+)
- Defer P2 Medium agents to v1.1

**If Specifications Fall Behind:**
- Use AI-assisted generation (Claude/GPT-4)
- Simplify tool counts (4-6 instead of 6-8)
- Defer nice-to-have features to v1.1

**If Budget Overruns:**
- Reduce scope to 70 agents for v1.0 (defer 14 to v1.1)
- Use cheaper LLM models for testing
- Defer infrastructure costs to post-launch

**If Timeline Extends:**
- Target: June 30, 2026 (v1.0.0 GA)
- Acceptable: August 31, 2026 (2 month slip)
- Maximum: September 30, 2026 (3 month slip)
- Beyond 3 months: Re-evaluate scope
