## Section 5: Data Quality Guidelines

### Best Practices for High-Quality PCF Data

**1. Use Primary Data Wherever Possible**
- ✅ Measure actual energy consumption at your facilities
- ✅ Use supplier-specific emission factors
- ✅ Track actual material quantities
- ❌ Avoid generic industry averages when primary data available

**2. Document Your Methodology**
- ✅ Clearly state what's included and excluded
- ✅ Explain allocation methods for co-products
- ✅ Reference standards followed
- ✅ Specify database versions (e.g., Ecoinvent 3.9)

**3. Keep Data Current**
- ✅ Update PCF data annually minimum
- ✅ Note if significant process changes occurred
- ✅ Use most recent emission factors
- ✅ Reflect current product composition

**4. Be Transparent About Uncertainty**
- ✅ Provide uncertainty ranges if available
- ✅ Explain limitations in data
- ✅ Note assumptions made
- ✅ Identify areas for improvement

**5. Validate Before Submitting**
- ✅ Cross-check calculations
- ✅ Compare to similar products
- ✅ Review for order-of-magnitude errors
- ✅ Have colleague review

**💡 Tip**: Higher quality data leads to better customer relationships and more accurate supply chain emissions.

### Common Data Quality Issues

**Issue: Incomplete System Boundaries**
**Problem**: Excluding significant lifecycle stages
**Solution**: Clearly document what's included. If cradle-to-gate, ensure all upstream processes covered.

**Issue: Outdated Data**
**Problem**: Using emission factors or production data more than 5 years old
**Solution**: Update with current data. Note temporal applicability in submission.

**Issue: Inconsistent Units**
**Problem**: Mixing units (e.g., kg and lbs, kWh and MJ)
**Solution**: Standardize on metric units. Portal assumes kg, km, kWh unless specified.

**Issue: Missing Allocation Documentation**
**Problem**: Not explaining how emissions split between co-products
**Solution**: Document allocation basis (mass, energy, economic value) and calculations.

**Issue: Unrealistic Precision**
**Problem**: Reporting 7.3458291 kgCO2e when underlying data doesn't support that precision
**Solution**: Round to appropriate precision (typically 2-3 significant figures).

**Issue: Ignoring Uncertainty**
**Problem**: Presenting estimates as exact values
**Solution**: Provide uncertainty range or acknowledge data limitations.

## FAQ

**Q: How long does it take to complete my first submission?**
**A**: First submission typically takes 30-45 minutes including registration. Subsequent submissions are faster (15-20 minutes) as you're familiar with the process. Bulk uploads can submit dozens of products in similar time.

**Q: What if I don't have a full LCA for my product?**
**A**: You have options:
1. Simplified PCF calculator (portal provides)
2. Estimate based on materials and energy
3. Use industry average with documentation
4. Commission LCA study (most accurate)
5. Engage LCA consultant for guidance
Note: Lower quality data is better than no data. Document limitations clearly.

**Q: Can I submit in units other than kgCO2e?**
**A**: Platform standardizes on kgCO2e (kilograms CO2 equivalent), which includes all greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, etc.) converted to CO2 equivalents using GWP100. If you have data in other units:
- tCO2e (tonnes): Convert by dividing by 1000
- gCO2e (grams): Convert by multiplying by 1000
- lbsCO2e (pounds): Convert by multiplying by 0.453592

**Q: How often should I update my PCF data?**
**A**: Best practices:
- Annually: Minimum for most products
- When significant changes occur: New materials, process changes, energy mix changes
- When customer requests: Some industries require quarterly updates
- When emission factors update: Major database updates
Set up reminders to review annually even if no changes.

**Q: Is my data shared with other companies?**
**A**: No. Your PCF data is shared only with:
1. Customers you explicitly submit to
2. No other suppliers or competitors
3. Anonymized aggregates may be used for industry benchmarking (opt-in only)
You control who sees your data. Each customer relationship is isolated.

**Q: What if my customer uses a different PCF format?**
**A**: Portal uses PACT Pathfinder (industry standard), which is compatible with:
- ISO 14067
- GHG Protocol Product Standard
- WBCSD Guidance
- Most EPD formats
If customer needs different format, portal can export to:
- Excel (custom template)
- JSON (via API)
- EPD XML
Contact support for format conversion assistance.

**Q: Do I need to pay to use the supplier portal?**
**A**: No. Supplier portal access is free for invited suppliers. Your customer's organization pays for the platform. You only need:
- Valid invitation from customer
- Internet connection
- Modern web browser
No subscription or per-submission fees.

**Q: Can multiple people from my company access the portal?**
**A**: Yes. Invite colleagues:
1. Navigate to Profile > Team Members
2. Click "Invite Team Member"
3. Enter their email and role
4. They receive invitation to register
Roles available:
- Admin: Full access, manage team
- Contributor: Submit and edit data
- Viewer: Read-only access
Useful for collaboration between sustainability, engineering, and quality teams.

**Q: What happens if I miss the submission deadline?**
**A**: Deadlines are guidelines to help customers with their reporting timelines. If you miss a deadline:
1. Submit as soon as possible
2. Message customer explaining delay
3. Most customers will accept late submissions
4. May affect their reporting schedule
5. Future deadlines may be adjusted
Communicate proactively if you'll miss a deadline.

**Q: Can I see how my PCF data is used in my customer's reports?**
**A**: Some customers share reports back with suppliers, but this varies by organization. You can:
1. Request to see how your data was used
2. Ask for summary of their Scope 3 results
3. Some customers provide supplier-specific feedback
4. Transparency depends on customer policy
This is at customer's discretion for confidentiality reasons.

## Success Stories

### Example: Industrial Manufacturer Reduces Time by 75%

"Before the portal, each customer had their own Excel template and submission process. We spent 2-3 hours per customer submission. Now with the portal, we submit to multiple customers in 30 minutes by sharing data. The bulk upload feature handles our 50+ product portfolio efficiently."

*- Sustainability Manager, Industrial Components Manufacturer*

### Example: Food Producer Improves Data Quality Rating from 2 to 4

"The portal's data quality guidance helped us identify gaps in our methodology. We invested in supplier-specific data collection and moved from generic EEIO factors to measured values. Our quality rating improved from 2 to 4, and customers noticed - we've won new business because of our transparent, high-quality PCF data."

*- Environmental Engineer, Food Ingredients Supplier*

### Example: Chemical Supplier Wins New Business

"Three customers requested PCF data within the same month. Thanks to the portal, we submitted once and shared with all three. Two months later, we learned our high-quality data (verified ISO 14067) was a deciding factor in a major contract renewal. The portal helped us turn sustainability data into competitive advantage."
