Demo Script #3: Cascade Heat Pump System for High-Temperature Industrial Application

Scenario:
- Industrial facility requiring high-temperature process heat (>160°F)
- Single-stage heat pump inefficient due to large temperature lift
- Solution: Cascade (two-stage) heat pump system
- Target: Achieve 140°F+ temperature lift with reasonable COP

Expected Results:
- Stage 1 COP: 3.5-4.0 (60°F → 120°F)
- Stage 2 COP: 2.8-3.2 (120°F → 200°F)
- Overall System COP: 2.2-2.5
- Payback: 6.5 years
- CO2 reduction: 400-500 metric tons/year

Technologies:
- Two-stage cascade configuration
- Stage 1: R134a (low-temperature circuit)
- Stage 2: R245fa (high-temperature circuit)
- Inter-stage heat exchanger (cascade condenser)
- Screw compressors for both stages
