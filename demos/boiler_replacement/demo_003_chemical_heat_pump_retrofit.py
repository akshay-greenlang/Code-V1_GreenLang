Demo #3: Chemical Plant - Heat Pump Boiler Retrofit

Scenario:
- Chemical plant with steam boiler for low-temperature process heat
- Current: 78% efficiency boiler, 100 psig steam de-superheated to 80°C
- Target: Industrial heat pump (COP 3.2) directly serving process
- Expected: 50% energy cost reduction, 5.2 year payback, $210k savings

Results:
- Old: 78% boiler, 35,000 MMBtu/year gas
- New: Heat pump COP 3.2, 3,200,000 kWh/year electricity
- Energy cost reduction: 52%
- Annual savings: $210,000
- Capital: $1,050,000 (after incentives)
- Payback: 5.0 years
- CO2 reduction: 800 tonnes/year (cleaner grid vs. gas)
