    notes: "Must ensure additionality, permanence, no leakage. Sequestration rate highest in first 20 years."

# Usage Notes
usage_notes:
  hydrogen:
    critical_insight: "Grid-based 'green' hydrogen only achieves GHG reduction if grid carbon intensity <0.2 kg CO2e/kWh. Otherwise, blue hydrogen (3.5 kg) or dedicated renewables are better."
    color_codes:
      grey: "Steam Methane Reforming (10.5 kg CO2e/kg) - fossil, no CCS"
      blue: "SMR + 85% CCS (3.5 kg CO2e/kg) - fossil with capture"
      green: "Renewable electrolysis (0.3-0.8 kg CO2e/kg) - fully renewable"
      turquoise: "Methane pyrolysis (1.8 kg CO2e/kg) - no CO2 produced, carbon black co-product"
      pink: "Nuclear electrolysis (0.3 kg CO2e/kg) - low-carbon electricity"

  recycling:
    calculation_method: "Avoided Emissions = Virgin Production - Recycling Process"
    reporting: "Report as Scope 3 Category 1 (Purchased Goods) avoided emissions, separate from offsets"
    double_counting_warning: "Do not claim both recycling credit and virgin material reduction"

  carbon_removal:
    permanence: "DAC + geological storage: >10,000 years. Biochar: >1,000 years. Enhanced weathering: permanent (mineralization). Soil carbon: 20-100 years. Forests: 100 years (if protected)."
    additionality_requirement: "Must demonstrate removal would not occur without project/payment"
    verification_standards: "Use Puro.earth, Verra, Gold Standard certified credits for corporate claims"
    insetting_vs_offsetting: "Insetting = removal in own value chain (biochar in company's soil). Offsetting = external credit purchase."
    scope_accounting: "Not included in Scope 1/2/3. Report separately as 'GHG Removals' per CSRD ESRS E1-6."
