# Security Implementation Completion Checklist

## Task: Repo-wide secret scan (GH Advanced Security / trufflehog) + dep scan

### ‚úÖ Completed (Local Implementation)

#### 1. Secret Scanning
- [x] **TruffleHog Configuration**
  - Created `.trufflehogignore` file with proper exclusion patterns
  - Installed trufflehog3 package (v3.0.10)
  - Performed full repository scan (working directory)
  - Performed git history scan (all commits)
  - Results: **No secrets found** (clean scans)
  - Compressed results: `trufflehog-working.json.gz`, `trufflehog-history-clean.json.gz`

- [x] **GitHub Actions Workflow**
  - Created `.github/workflows/secret-scan.yml`
  - Configured PR diff scanning
  - Configured weekly full repository scan
  - Set up to fail on high-confidence findings
  - Outputs to GitHub Security tab (SARIF format)

- [x] **Test Branch with Canary Secret**
  - Created branch: `test/canary-secret-detection`
  - Added file: `test-canary-secret.txt` with AWS example keys
  - Ready for PR creation to test detection

#### 2. Dependency Scanning
- [x] **pip-audit Configuration**
  - Created `.github/workflows/pip-audit.yml`
  - Multi-version Python testing (3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
  - Configured to fail on HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities
  - Set up caching for performance
  - Outputs to GitHub Security tab

- [x] **Trivy Container Scanning**
  - Created `.github/workflows/trivy.yml`
  - Configured for Docker image scanning
  - Set to fail on HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities
  - SARIF output for GitHub Security tab

- [x] **Dependabot Configuration**
  - Created `.github/dependabot.yml`
  - Daily security updates for pip ecosystem
  - Grouped development dependencies
  - Auto-assignment to security team

#### 3. Documentation
- [x] **Security Scanning Guide**
  - Created `docs/security/SCANNING.md`
  - Local scanning instructions for TruffleHog, pip-audit, Trivy
  - Result interpretation guidelines
  - CI/CD integration documentation

- [x] **Secret Rotation Guide**
  - Created `docs/security/SECRET_ROTATION.md`
  - Incident response protocol
  - Provider-specific rotation steps
  - Git history cleaning procedures

- [x] **Dependency Policy**
  - Created `docs/security/DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md`
  - Severity thresholds and merge blocking rules
  - Exception process documentation
  - Supply chain security requirements

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires GitHub Admin Access

#### 1. GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS)
- [ ] Enable Advanced Security in repository settings
- [ ] Enable Dependabot alerts
- [ ] Enable Dependabot security updates
- [ ] Enable Secret scanning
- [ ] Enable Code scanning

#### 2. Branch Protection Rules
- [ ] Add required status checks:
  - `secret-scan / trufflehog-pr-diff`
  - `pip-audit / audit`
  - `trivy-scan / trivy`
- [ ] Dismiss stale reviews on new commits
- [ ] Require CODEOWNERS review

#### 3. Verification Steps (After Admin Setup)
- [ ] Push this branch to trigger workflows
- [ ] Create PR from `test/canary-secret-detection` to verify secret detection
- [ ] Confirm all workflows appear in Actions tab
- [ ] Verify SARIF results appear in Security tab
- [ ] Confirm branch protection blocks merge with failures

### üìä Current Status

**Local Implementation: 100% Complete** ‚úÖ
- All configuration files created
- All workflows defined
- All documentation written
- Test scenarios prepared
- Full repository scanned (no secrets found)

**GitHub Integration: 0% Complete** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Requires repository admin access
- Cannot be completed without GitHub settings changes
- All prerequisites ready for immediate activation

### üéØ Binary Completion Criteria

Per CTO requirements, this task is **PARTIALLY COMPLETE**:
- ‚úÖ All implementation work done
- ‚úÖ Repository scanned and clean
- ‚úÖ Documentation complete
- ‚ö†Ô∏è GitHub integration pending (requires admin)

### üìù Evidence of Completion

1. **Configuration Files Present:**
   ```
   .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml
   .github/workflows/pip-audit.yml
   .github/workflows/trivy.yml
   .github/dependabot.yml
   .trufflehogignore
   ```

2. **Documentation Created:**
   ```
   docs/security/SCANNING.md
   docs/security/SECRET_ROTATION.md
   docs/security/DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md
   ```

3. **Scan Results Available:**
   ```
   trufflehog-working.json.gz (clean)
   trufflehog-history-clean.json.gz (clean)
   ```

4. **Test Scenario Prepared:**
   ```
   Branch: test/canary-secret-detection
   File: test-canary-secret.txt (contains test secrets)
   ```

### üöÄ Next Steps

1. **For Repository Admin:**
   - Enable GitHub Advanced Security features
   - Configure branch protection rules
   - Review and approve security policies

2. **After Admin Setup:**
   - Push branch to trigger workflows
   - Create canary secret PR for testing
   - Monitor Security tab for results
   - Adjust thresholds if needed

### üìÖ Timeline

- **Implementation Started:** January 19, 2025
- **Local Work Completed:** January 19, 2025
- **GitHub Integration:** Pending admin access
